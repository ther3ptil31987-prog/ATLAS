# ATLAS Setup — macOS (Apple Silicon, Hybrid Metal + Docker)

This is the install guide for **Apple Silicon Macs** (M1, M2, M3, M4). Intel Macs should use the [Vulkan path](SETUP.md#vulkan--cross-vendor-fallback) instead — Metal is Apple-Silicon-only.

ATLAS on Mac uses a **hybrid architecture** (#32):

- **llama-server** runs **natively** on macOS with **Metal** GPU acceleration (5-10x faster than running it inside Docker via MoltenVK)
- **Everything else** (proxy, v3-service, geometric-lens, sandbox) runs in **Docker** via `docker-compose.macos.yml`

The hybrid keeps the rest of ATLAS unchanged from the Linux + CUDA/ROCm path while letting Mac users get native Metal inference speed.

## Prerequisites

| Component | Why | How to install |
|---|---|---|
| macOS 14+ (Sonoma or newer; the maintainer-verified configuration — see [SUPPORT_MATRIX.md](../SUPPORT_MATRIX.md)) | Metal API requirements; earlier versions may work but are untested | System Settings → Software Update |
| Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) | Metal GPU backend | `uname -m` should print `arm64` |
| 16 GB unified memory | medium tier minimum (9B-Q6 + KV cache) | 32 GB+ recommended for full context |
| Xcode Command Line Tools | cmake, git, metal-cpp headers | `xcode-select --install` |
| Homebrew | brew package manager | https://brew.sh |
| pipx | install atlas CLI in an isolated venv (Homebrew Python enforces PEP 668, plain `pip install` is blocked) | `brew install pipx` (the setup script handles this automatically) |
| Go 1.26.2+ | build the atlas-tui binary (Bubbletea TUI client invoked by `atlas`) | `brew install go` (the setup script handles this automatically) |
| Docker Desktop | runs the 4 non-inference services | https://docker.com/products/docker-desktop |

Notes:

- **You do NOT need full Xcode** — just the Command Line Tools (~2 GB vs ~12 GB).
- **Docker Desktop is still required** — only `llama-server` runs natively, everything else stays in containers.
- **8 GB Macs:** technically supported on the `small` tier (7B-Q4 model) but performance will be tight. 16 GB is the realistic floor.

## Install — TL;DR

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inferstep/ATLAS.git
cd ATLAS

# One-time setup (5-10 minutes): brew deps + builds llama.cpp with Metal
./scripts/atlas-setup-macos.sh

# Wizard: detects Apple Silicon, writes .env for the hybrid Metal path
atlas init

# Bring up the stack — TWO terminals:
# Terminal 1 (foreground):
./scripts/atlas-llama-macos.sh

# Terminal 2:
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.macos.yml up -d

# Verify everything is healthy
atlas doctor

# Start coding (from your project directory)
cd /path/to/your/project
atlas
```

## Install — step by step

### Step 1: Run the setup script

```bash
./scripts/atlas-setup-macos.sh
```

What this does (idempotent, re-runs are cheap; the numbering below matches the `[N/8]` progress markers the script prints):

1. Verifies macOS + Apple Silicon (on an Intel Mac it warns that Metal is Apple-Silicon-only, suggests the Docker + Vulkan path instead, and asks `Continue anyway? [y/N]` — confirming proceeds with a CPU-only build)
2. Checks Xcode Command Line Tools are installed
3. Verifies Homebrew is installed, then installs missing brew packages: `cmake`, `git`, `python@3.12`, `pipx`, `go`
4. Reads `LLAMA_CPP_REV` from `inference/Dockerfile.v31` (the pinned SHA used by the Docker images — keeps the native build in lockstep with the linux + cuda/rocm builds)
5. Fetches llama.cpp at that exact SHA, applies the hidden-states patch + spec-decode embeddings fix
6. Builds `llama-server` with `-DGGML_METAL=ON -DGGML_METAL_USE_BF16=ON` (Apple GPU compute backend, bf16 support for M3/M4) and installs the binary to `~/.atlas/macos/bin/llama-server-metal` (plus `llama-cli-metal` and `llama-cvector-generator-metal` for ASA workflows)
7. Installs the `atlas` Python CLI via `pipx install --editable` (isolated venv, dodges Homebrew Python's PEP 668 enforcement)
8. Builds the `atlas-tui` Go binary and installs it to `~/.local/bin/atlas-tui` (the Bubbletea TUI client that `atlas` shells out to for the interactive session)

Optional flags:

```bash
./scripts/atlas-setup-macos.sh --rebuild        # force rebuild even if SHA matches
./scripts/atlas-setup-macos.sh --prefix /opt/atlas  # install to a different prefix
```

For a custom prefix, set `ATLAS_MACOS_PREFIX=/opt/atlas` in `.env` or pass
`--prefix /opt/atlas` to the launcher. `atlas doctor` reads the same setting.

The build step is the slow one (~5-10 min depending on Mac generation). The setup script skips it on re-runs when the existing binary's stored SHA matches `LLAMA_CPP_REV`.

### Step 2: Run the wizard

```bash
atlas init
```

The wizard detects Apple Silicon and writes a `.env` for the hybrid Metal path. You'll see something like:

```
[2/5] Selecting model…
  Apple Silicon detected. Recommended setup: native Metal inference + Docker
  for the supporting services.

  Before you continue: run ./scripts/atlas-setup-macos.sh if you haven't.
  It installs the build tools and compiles llama.cpp with Metal. Full
  instructions in docs/SETUP_MACOS.md.

  Other options:
    --backend vulkan   Docker-only (no native build, slower)
  Continue with the recommended setup? [Y/n]
```

If you want the slow docker-only fallback instead (e.g. you're scripting a CI run on a Mac and don't want to install brew), re-run with `atlas init --backend vulkan`.

### Step 3: Start the native llama-server

In a **new terminal** (the launcher runs in the foreground):

```bash
./scripts/atlas-llama-macos.sh
```

This reads `.env` and starts `llama-server-metal` with the same flags as the Docker entrypoint. You'll see a banner like:

```
ATLAS llama-server (native macOS Metal) — #32 hybrid path
  Model:                /Users/you/ATLAS/models/<selected-model>.gguf
  Context length:       32768
  Parallel slots:       1
  KV cache K / V:       q8_0 / q4_0
  Port:                 8080
  Host:                 127.0.0.1
  Batch / micro-batch:  1024 / 1024
  ASA steering:         disabled
  Binary:               /Users/you/.atlas/macos/bin/llama-server-metal
```

Stop with Ctrl-C. On stop the docker stack's proxy will start serving 502s until you re-launch.

### Step 4: Bring up the docker stack

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.macos.yml up -d
```

The macOS overlay swaps the `llama-server` service for a pinned `alpine/socat` container that forwards Docker-internal `llama-server:8080` → `host.docker.internal:${ATLAS_LLAMA_PORT:-8080}` (where the native server you started in Step 3 is listening). Its healthcheck tests that complete connection, so dependent services wait until native inference is accepting connections. The other services come up unchanged from the base compose file.

If port 8080 is already occupied, set `ATLAS_LLAMA_PORT` in `.env` or launch with `./scripts/atlas-llama-macos.sh --port 8081`, then bring the compose stack up with the same `ATLAS_LLAMA_PORT` value. The container-side URL remains `http://llama-server:8080`; only the native host-side port changes.

First-time pull is small (~4 MB for socat if not cached; the v3 / lens / proxy / sandbox images come from GHCR, ~600 MB total).

### Step 5: Verify

```bash
atlas doctor
```

You should see (among other checks):

```
  [OK]  arch          aarch64 (Apple Silicon) — Metal hybrid path supported (#32)
  [OK]  metal-native  native llama-server up at /Users/you/.atlas/macos/bin/llama-server-metal, listening on :8080
```

The `metal-native` check only fires when `ATLAS_BACKEND=metal` is set (which `atlas init` does on your Mac). It catches:

- Setup script was never run → binary missing
- Setup ran but binary won't execute (corrupt build) → re-run with `--rebuild`
- Native llama-server isn't running → warn (start it in step 3)

### Step 6: Use ATLAS

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
atlas
```

Same UX as Linux + CUDA. The TUI connects to the proxy on localhost:8090; the proxy talks to the docker stack (lens, v3, sandbox) which talks to the native llama-server via socat.

## How it actually works under the hood

```
Your Mac
 |
 |- Native process: ./scripts/atlas-llama-macos.sh
 |   |- llama-server-metal listening on :${ATLAS_LLAMA_PORT:-8080} (Apple GPU via Metal)
 |
 |- Docker Desktop
     |- docker-compose stack (4 services):
     |   |- atlas-proxy        (Go binary, port 8090)
     |   |- v3-service         (Python, port 8070)
     |   |- geometric-lens     (Python, port 8099)
     |   |- sandbox            (Python, port 30820)
     |   |- llama-server slot  ← socat: forwards container :8080 to host.docker.internal:${ATLAS_LLAMA_PORT:-8080}
     |
     |- (Each service connects to http://llama-server:8080 from the base
     |   compose file — that name now resolves to the socat container which
     |   forwards every connection to the native server on the host.)
```

The 4 Docker services and the base `docker-compose.yml` are unchanged — only the `docker-compose.macos.yml` overlay differs, so `atlas init` / `atlas doctor` / `atlas` behave the same as on Linux. Native Metal (`-DGGML_METAL=ON`) uses Apple's GPU directly. The path is reversible: stop the native server and rerun `atlas init --backend vulkan` to fall back to the docker-only MoltenVK path.

## Troubleshooting

### `atlas doctor` says `metal-native: fail — native llama-server not found`

You haven't run the setup script, or the configured prefix does not match where it was installed. The default binary path is `~/.atlas/macos/bin/llama-server-metal`. Either:

- Run `./scripts/atlas-setup-macos.sh` (no flags)
- Or set `ATLAS_MACOS_PREFIX=/your/custom/prefix` in `.env`
- Or launch explicitly with `./scripts/atlas-llama-macos.sh --prefix /your/custom/prefix`

### `atlas doctor` says `metal-native: warn — nothing listening on the configured llama port`

The binary is installed but you haven't started it. Open a new terminal and run `./scripts/atlas-llama-macos.sh`. The launcher stays in the foreground; leave it running.

### Native llama-server starts but Docker services can't reach it

Docker Desktop on Mac auto-resolves `host.docker.internal` to the host's loopback. If for some reason it doesn't (very old Docker Desktop, custom DNS setup):

```bash
# Inside any container, this should print an IP that points back to your Mac:
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.macos.yml exec atlas-proxy \
  nslookup host.docker.internal
```

If that fails, update Docker Desktop to 4.x or newer.

### llama-server fails to load model: `unable to allocate Metal buffer`

Unified memory is shared with the OS. Realistic GPU budget on Apple Silicon is ~70% of total RAM under load. If you're trying to load a model larger than that:

- 16 GB Mac: stick to 7B-Q4 (~4 GB) or 9B-Q4_K_M (~5.5 GB)
- 32 GB Mac: 9B-Q6 (~7.5 GB) or 14B-Q5 (~10 GB) fits comfortably
- 64 GB+ Mac: 32B-Q5 (~22 GB) or larger

Run `atlas tier` to see the recommendation for your hardware.

### `atlas` says `atlas-tui binary not found and Go is not available to build it`

Plain `atlas` (or `atlas tui`) prints this when it can't find or build the TUI binary; `atlas --help` never triggers it — help exits before the TUI lookup. It means the setup script that ran was an older one that didn't install Go + build the TUI. Two recovery paths:

1. **Re-run the latest setup script** (it installs `go` via brew in step 3 + builds the TUI in step 8):
   ```bash
   git pull origin dev
   ./scripts/atlas-setup-macos.sh
   ```

2. **Manual fix without re-running setup** (skip the cmake rebuild):
   ```bash
   brew install go
   cd <ATLAS-repo>/tui && go build -o ~/.local/bin/atlas-tui .
   ```

Either way, plain `atlas` should then get past the binary check and launch the TUI (it verifies the proxy is reachable first).

### Setup script fails at step 7 with `error: externally-managed-environment`

This is Homebrew Python's PEP 668 enforcement — `pip install` and `pip install --user` are blocked on macOS because they could break the brew install. The setup script already handles this by using `pipx` (installed in step 3), so this error means you're on an older version of the setup script. Two recovery paths:

1. **Re-run the latest setup script** (it now installs `pipx` automatically and uses it for the atlas install):
   ```bash
   git pull origin dev
   ./scripts/atlas-setup-macos.sh
   ```

2. **Manual fix without re-running setup** (skip the cmake rebuild):
   ```bash
   brew install pipx
   pipx ensurepath
   cd ~/ATLAS
   pipx install --force --editable .
   source ~/.zprofile     # reload PATH
   ```

Either path puts the `atlas` binary in `~/.local/bin/` with its dependencies isolated in a pipx-managed venv. `git pull` upgrades atlas in place because we used `--editable`.

### Setup script fails at `hidden-states patch does not apply`

Upstream llama.cpp has drifted past the pinned SHA. See [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md § Rebuilding llama.cpp](TROUBLESHOOTING.md#rebuilding-llamacpp-new-model-architecture-or-patch-drift) for the bump runbook.

### I want to skip the native build entirely (use only Docker)

The Vulkan-via-MoltenVK path still works:

```bash
atlas init --backend vulkan
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.vulkan.yml up -d
```

Inference will be slower but you don't need brew, cmake, or the setup script.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Hardware validation on M3 Pro 18 GB
- [ ] Hardware validation on M3 Max 36+ GB
- [ ] Hardware validation on M4 series
- [ ] Pre-built `llama-server-metal` binaries on GHCR releases (skip the build step)
- [ ] Pure-native path (drop Docker entirely on Mac, use launchd) — separate ticket if there's demand
