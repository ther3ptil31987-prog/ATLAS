# ATLAS API Reference

API endpoints for each ATLAS service. All services communicate over HTTP/JSON. Streaming endpoints use Server-Sent Events (SSE).

> **Ports listed are defaults.** All are configurable via environment variables (see [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md)). The HTTP contracts below are deployment-mode-agnostic — only the host:port differs. Quick reference:
>
> | Service | Docker Compose (host=container) | Bare metal (env-configured) | K3s NodePort (`atlas.conf.example`) |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | atlas-proxy | `8090` | `ATLAS_PROXY_PORT` (default 8090) | `ATLAS_PROXY_NODEPORT` (default 30080) |
> | v3-service | `8070` | `ATLAS_V3_PORT` (default 8070) | `ATLAS_V3_NODEPORT` (default 30070) |
> | geometric-lens | `8099` | `ATLAS_LENS_PORT` (default 8099) | `ATLAS_LENS_NODEPORT` (default 31144) |
> | sandbox | host `30820` → container `8020` | `ATLAS_SANDBOX_PORT` (default 8020) | `ATLAS_SANDBOX_NODEPORT` (default 30820) |
> | llama-server | `8080` | `ATLAS_LLAMA_PORT` (default 8080) | `ATLAS_LLAMA_NODEPORT` (default 32735) |

## atlas-proxy (Port 8090)

The main entry point. Wraps llama-server with an agent loop, grammar-constrained tool calls, Lens scoring, and sandbox verification.

**This is the public client surface.** The canonical client is [atlas-tui](CLI.md), but the contract below is stable and other front-ends (web UIs, editor plugins, CI bots, custom CLIs) can use it directly.

**Public client API** — the endpoints a front-end drives. The three a minimal client must implement are `/v1/agent`, `/cancel`, and `/v1/permission`; the rest are optional enrichments.

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/v1/agent` | POST | Send a user message, stream back a turn (tool calls, results, tokens, completion) as SSE |
| `/cancel` | POST | Abort an in-flight `/v1/agent` turn by `session_id` |
| `/v1/permission` | POST | Answer a `permission_request` (approve/deny a destructive tool call mid-turn) |
| `/events` | GET | Subscribe to a global typed-envelope event broker — same events the TUI's pipeline pane uses |
| `/v1/calibration/status` | GET | Lens + ASA compat verdict for the loaded model — what the TUI's Pipeline pane badge reads on startup |
| `/feedback` | POST | Record a pass's human verdict (per-file accept/deny and/or pass-level thumbs) as weighted lens training samples |
| `/v1/lens/training-status` | GET | Collected lens-sample counts for the loaded model plus a retrain-available flag |

**OpenAI compatibility:**

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/v1/chat/completions` | POST | OpenAI-compatible chat completions — a direct passthrough to llama-server for SDK compatibility |
| `/v1/models` | GET | List available models (OpenAI-compatible). `/models` (no `/v1/` prefix) is an alias. |

**Diagnostics:**

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/health` | GET | Liveness — always 200, `status` reports `"ok"` or `"degraded"` |
| `/ready` | GET | Readiness probe — 200 only when inference, lens scoring (`lens/ready`), the sandbox, and v3-service are all healthy; 503 otherwise. Use this for load-balancer / orchestrator health checks; use `/health` for informational status. |
| `/version` | GET | API version, SSE protocol version, and the full error-code set — see [Versioning and error codes](#versioning-and-error-codes) |

**Catch-all:** any unmatched path is proxied directly to llama-server.

---

### POST /v1/agent

Tool-based agent endpoint. Sends a user message, runs the agent loop (LLM → tool call → tool result → repeat) until the model emits `done` or hits the turn cap, and streams every step back as SSE.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "Add a snake game in Python and verify it runs",
  "working_dir": "/home/me/projects/snake",
  "mode": "default",
  "session_id": "tui-7f3a2c1b"
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `message` | string | (required) | The user's request |
| `working_dir` | string | `"."` | Host-side working directory. Inside the proxy container this is overridden to `ATLAS_WORKSPACE_DIR` (the bind-mount target — `/workspace` by default). The startup wrapper aligns the bind mount to the user's cwd, so writes land in the right place. |
| `mode` | string | `"default"` | Permission mode: `"default"` (asks before `write_file`, `delete_file`, `stop_background` and every command: `run_command`, `run_background`; in-place edits and `move_file` run without asking), `"accept-edits"` (also runs `write_file` without asking; still asks before deletes and commands), `"yolo"` (asks for nothing) |
| `session_id` | string | `""` | Required for `/cancel` and for the interactive permission prompt (`/v1/permission`). The proxy keys the cancel handle and pending permission requests by this id while the turn is running. **Without a session_id, destructive tool calls in `default`/`accept-edits` mode are denied** (there is no channel to answer the prompt) — unattended clients use `mode:"yolo"` or pre-approve tools via `session_allowed_tools`. |
| `history` | array | `[]` | Optional. Prior-turn `{role, content}` messages (`"user"` / `"assistant"`) the client wants replayed into the conversation before the new message. Capped at the most recent 40 entries. Omit for a single-turn request. |
| `session_allowed_tools` | array | `[]` | Optional. Tool names the user has approved for the whole session (e.g. from an "allow for session" choice). The proxy skips the interactive permission prompt for these. The client re-sends the current list on each turn. |
| `bypass_v3` | bool | `false` | Optional. Disables V3 orchestration for the turn. Used by the TUI's `/demo` split-pane baseline. |
| `disable_fresh_slot` | bool | `false` | Optional. Keeps the pre-warmed KV-cache prefix instead of requesting a fresh slot. Used by `/demo`. |
| `sandbox_subdir` | string | `""` | Optional. Confines the turn to a subdirectory of the workspace (a bare directory name — anything with path separators or traversal is ignored). `/demo` uses one per pane so concurrent sessions don't clobber each other's files. |

**Response:** `text/event-stream` of `data: {...}\n\n` lines. The proxy flushes a `: connected\n\n` SSE comment on connect so clients see HTTP/200 immediately, then emits typed events for the duration of the turn, terminated by `data: [DONE]\n\n`.

#### Event types on `/v1/agent`

Every event has the shape `{"type":"<name>","data":{...}}`. Types in emission order for a typical turn:

| Type | When | Payload |
|------|------|---------|
| `turn_start` | At the start of every agent loop iteration | `turn` (int), `messages` (int), `trimmed` (bool, true if conversation history was trimmed for context window) |
| `llm_call_start` | Before each LLM round-trip | `turn`, `messages`, `prompt_tokens` (estimated, chars/4) |
| `llm_prompt_progress` | Every ~100 ms while llama-server is in prompt-eval (before any decoded token). Real prompt-eval counters come from llama-server's `/slots` endpoint; when `/slots` returns 404/501 the poller keeps emitting with `processed=0` and the chars/4 estimate as `total` — the elapsed timer is still the useful signal. | `processed` (int), `total` (int), `pct` (0–1 float), `elapsed_ms` (int). Stops as soon as `llm_first_token` fires. |
| `llm_first_token` | First streamed delta from llama-server | `prompt_ms` (time-to-first-token in milliseconds) |
| `llm_token` | Each streamed delta | `text` (the delta string — typically a token or two) |
| `llm_call_end` | LLM call finished | `turn`, `tokens` (this call), `total_tokens` (cumulative for the turn), `ms`, `chars`. On error: `error` is added, `chars` is absent, and `tokens` is `0`. |
| `tool_call` | Model emitted a `{"type":"tool_call",...}` JSON | `name` (string), `args` (raw JSON), `turn` |
| `permission_request` | A destructive tool call is awaiting approval in `default`/`accept-edits` mode. The turn pauses until the client answers via `POST /v1/permission` (or the client disconnects/cancels, or the fail-safe timeout denies). | `tool_name` (string), `args` (raw JSON), `message` (human-readable description), `tool_call_id` (string — echo back on `/v1/permission`) |
| `permission_denied` | The pending tool call was denied (by the client, a disconnect/cancel, or the timeout) | `tool` (the tool name) |
| `tool_result` | Tool finished executing | `tool`, `success` (bool), `data` (raw JSON), `error` (string), `elapsed` (Go duration string, e.g. `"245ms"`) |
| `text` | Model emitted a `{"type":"text","content":"..."}` JSON (conversational reply) | `content` (string) |
| `v3_progress` | V3 pipeline stage that doesn't have a dedicated typed event yet (fallback) | `message` (string) — humanized stage label |
| `v3_llm_start` / `v3_llm_end` | V3's internal LLMAdapter started / finished a call (planner, candidate generation, repair, etc.) | `detail` (string), `call` (int), `tokens` (int, on `llm_end`), `elapsed_ms` (int, on `llm_end`), `max_tokens`, `temperature` (on `llm_start`) |
| `v3_token` | V3's internal LLM streamed a token | `text` (delta string) |
| `v3_reasoning_token` | V3's internal LLM streamed a `reasoning_content` delta. Separate from `reasoning_token` so it targets the V3 streaming row rather than the agent's LLM row. | `text` (delta string) |
| `v3_phase` | V3 phase transition (`phase1`, `phase2`, `phase2_allocated`) | `stage`, `detail`, plus the CxGx allocation on `phase2_allocated`: `k` (candidate count, never below 3), `tier`, `base_tier` (the tier C(x) picked before escalation), `gx_escalation` (int, 0/1/2 tiers added by G(x)), `capped_from` (string, the tier before the wall-clock cap lowered it; empty when uncapped), `reason` (`gated`\|`budget_capped`\|`uncalibrated`) |
| `v3_plansearch` | PlanSearch step (`plansearch`, `plansearch_done`, `plansearch_error`) | `stage`, `detail`, `plans` (int), `candidates` (int, on `_done`), `tokens` (int, on `_done`) |
| `v3_divsampling` | DivSampling step (`divsampling`, `divsampling_done`, `divsampling_error`) | `stage`, `detail`, `slots` (int), `total` (int, on `_done`) |
| `v3_sandbox` | Per-candidate sandbox test (`sandbox_test`, `sandbox_pass`, `sandbox_fail`, `sandbox_done`) | `stage`, `detail`, `index` (int), `elapsed_ms` (int), `energy` (float, on `_pass`), `stderr` (string, first 120 chars on `_fail`), `passed` / `total` (on `_done`) |
| `v3_select` | Candidate selection (`selected`) | `stage`, `detail`, `index` (int), `energy` (float) |
| `v3_lens_per_step` | Per-token lens scoring of a generated candidate. Fires once per candidate. | `stage`, `detail`, `index` (int, candidate index), `source` (`plansearch`\|`divsampling`), `first_off_rails_idx` (int, -1 if none), `gx_score_min` (float), `gx_score_mean` (float), `cx_norm_max` (float), `n_tokens` (int) |
| `v3_lens_veto` | A sandbox-passing candidate was rejected because its `gx_min` fell below the model's severe-quality threshold. The candidate is marked failed and re-enters the Phase-3 repair pool; the energy fallback never returns it. Absent when the Lens is uncalibrated. | `stage`, `detail`, `index` (int, candidate index), `gx_score_min` (float), `first_off_rails_idx` (int, -1 if none) |
| `v3_structural_veto` | A sandbox-passing candidate was rejected because tree-sitter found direct-identifier calls resolving to no local def, import, builtin, or project symbol. The candidate is marked failed and re-enters the Phase-3 repair pool; the energy fallback never returns it. | `stage`, `detail`, `index` (int, candidate index), `n_unresolved` (int), `unresolved_calls` (string[], up to 5), `n_calls_total` (int) |
| `v3_call_chain_context` | Phase-3 repair injected a call-chain context block for the failing function. Informational. | `stage`, `detail`, `function` (string — the failing function name) |
| `symbol_index_injected` | Turn-zero auto-injection of function/class snippets for symbols named in the user message. | `matched` (string[] — matched symbol names), `n_files` (int — project files scanned), `skipped` (int — symbols that didn't resolve) |
| `pattern_context_injected` | Turn-zero injection of the lens pattern-cache reader's results (`POST /internal/patterns/context`): lessons from previous sessions whose pattern type matches the task, injected as one `[system note]` block. Absent when the lens is unreachable or returns nothing (fail-soft). | `count` (int — patterns injected, ≤3), `types` (string[] — the injected patterns' types) |
| `agent_lens_score` | Lens scored a `write_file` or `edit_file` tool call's content. Fires per write/edit before tool execution. | `tool` (`write_file`\|`edit_file`), `turn` (int), `n_tokens` (int), `first_off_rails_idx` (int, -1 if none), `gx_score_min` (float), `gx_score_mean` (float), `latency_ms` (float) |
| `agent_lens_intervention` | Lens detected consecutive low-quality writes against the model's `low`/`severe` thresholds and queued a corrective for the next LLM call. Absent when calibration is missing. | `turn` (int), `tool` (string), `reason` (string — the corrective injected into ctx.Messages) |
| `agent_repeat_intervention` | Proxy saw the same `(tool_name, args)` signature ≥3× in the last 8 turns and queued a corrective. | `turn` (int), `tool` (string), `reason` (string — the corrective injected into ctx.Messages) |
| `agent_reasoning_intervention` | Proxy saw the model's `reasoning_content` open with the same prefix for ≥3 consecutive turns and queued a corrective. | `turn` (int), `consecutive` (int — how many turns the snippet repeated), `snippet` (string — the normalized opening that triggered), `reason` (string — corrective injected into ctx.Messages) |
| `reasoning_token` | One delta from a model's optional `reasoning_content` stream during SSE chat completion. These tokens are forwarded to the TUI for live display. Distinct from `llm_token` (which carries the JSON tool-call content destined for parse). | `text` (string — single delta of reasoning prose) |
| `reasoning_budget_cut` | The `reasoning_content` stream exceeded the reasoning budget with no content emitted — the proxy cuts the stream and re-prompts. | `reasoning_chars` (int — reasoning chars accumulated when cut) |
| `content_loop_cut` | The proxy detected a verbatim repeating tail in the content stream (the model restating itself in a loop) and cut the stream. | `chars` (int — content chars accumulated when cut) |
| `v3_repair` | Phase 3 repair strategy (`phase3`, `pr_cot*`, `refinement*`, `fallback`, `fallback_all_vetoed`) | `stage`, `detail`, `strategy` (string: `pr_cot` / `refinement`), `failing` (int), `iterations` (int, on `refinement_pass`), `tokens` (int, on `_pass`) |
| `v3_probe` | Probe phase events (`probe`, `probe_light`, `probe_error`, `probe_retry`, `probe_failed`, `probe_scored`, `probe_sandbox`, `probe_pass`) | `stage`, `detail` |
| `v3_self_test` | Self-test generation/verify events (`self_test_gen`, `self_test_done`, `self_test_error`, `self_test_skip`, `self_test_verify`) | `stage`, `detail` |
| `v3_plan` | Plan-pipeline progress (`plan_start`, `plan_candidate`, `plan_candidate_scored`, `plan_candidate_unparseable`, `plan_candidate_error`, `plan_selected`, `plan_failed`). Per-token `token`/`llm_start`/`llm_end` events are filtered out at the proxy. | `stage`, `detail`, `index` (int, per-candidate), `score` (float, on `_scored`/`_selected`), `revision` (int, set when fired during a revise) |
| `plan_loaded` | A winning plan has been generated. Fires once after initial generation and again after each revision. Carries the full step list. | `steps` (array of `{id, action, target, why}`), `verify_step` (string id), `rationale` (string), `winning_score` (float), `revision` (int — 0 for initial plan, 1+ for revisions) |
| `plan_adherence` | Emitted after each tool call, indicating whether the call satisfied an outstanding plan step. Off-plan calls (`matched=false`, no `neutral`) accumulate into the off-streak counter that drives auto-revise. | On match: `matched=true`, `step_index`, `step_id`, `step_action`, `satisfied` (steps satisfied so far), `total`. On miss: `matched=false`, `tool`, `off_streak` (consecutive off-plan calls), `satisfied`, `total`. Recon tools (`read_file`, `list_directory`, `find_file`, `search_files`) emit the miss shape plus `neutral=true` — they don't satisfy steps but leave `off_streak` unchanged. |
| `plan_revise` | The off-streak crossed `planAutoReviseThreshold` (5) — a fresh plan is being generated. The next `plan_loaded` (with `revision>0`) supersedes the prior plan; `Satisfied` flags reset. | `reason` (string), `revision` (int, 1-indexed) |
| `done` | Agent loop ended cleanly | `summary` (string — empty for a `text`-shaped turn) |
| `error` | LLM/parse/turn-cap error | `error` (string) |

After the final event the server writes the SSE sentinel `data: [DONE]\n\n` and closes the response.

> A minimal chat client needs only `text`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `done`, `error`. The `llm_*` and `v3_*` events report model activity during the turn; ignore them if your UI doesn't render progress.

#### Stream parsing example (Python)

```python
import json, requests

with requests.post(
    "http://localhost:8090/v1/agent",
    json={"message": "fix the bug in app.py", "session_id": "client-1"},
    stream=True,
    timeout=(10, None),  # connect timeout 10s, no read timeout — turns can be long
) as r:
    r.raise_for_status()
    for line in r.iter_lines(decode_unicode=True):
        if not line or not line.startswith("data: "):
            continue
        body = line[6:]
        if body == "[DONE]":
            break
        evt = json.loads(body)
        t, d = evt["type"], evt["data"]
        if t == "tool_call":
            print(f"→ {d['name']}({d.get('args', {})})")
        elif t == "tool_result":
            print(f"  {'OK' if d['success'] else 'FAIL'} {d.get('elapsed', '')}")
        elif t == "text":
            print(d["content"])
        elif t == "done":
            print(f"✓ {d.get('summary', '')}")
        elif t == "error":
            print(f"✗ {d['error']}")
```

Full streaming chat with token-level rendering is roughly +20 lines (buffer `llm_token` deltas, flush on `llm_call_end`).

---

### POST /cancel

Abort an in-flight `/v1/agent` turn. Idempotent — repeated calls for the same session return 404.

**Request:**
```json
{"session_id": "tui-7f3a2c1b"}
```

**Response (200):**
```json
{"cancelled": true}
```

**Response (404):**
```json
{"cancelled": false}
```

When cancelled, the agent loop exits via `context.Canceled`, the SSE stream emits its trailing `[DONE]`, and the connection closes cleanly. Any in-flight LLM call to llama-server is also aborted via the cascading request context.

The TUI uses this on `Esc` mid-turn — see [CLI.md → Cancelling a turn](CLI.md).

---

### POST /v1/permission

Answer a `permission_request` event. In `default` and `accept-edits` mode the agent loop pauses on a destructive tool call and emits `permission_request`; the turn stays blocked until this endpoint delivers a decision, the client disconnects/cancels, or a fail-safe timeout denies (`ATLAS_PERMISSION_TIMEOUT_SEC`, default 600s). Idempotent — a decision for an unknown or already-resolved request returns 404.

**Request:**
```json
{"session_id": "tui-7f3a2c1b", "tool_call_id": "call_3", "decision": "allow", "scope": "once"}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `session_id` | string | The `session_id` of the paused `/v1/agent` turn |
| `tool_call_id` | string | The `tool_call_id` from the `permission_request` event |
| `decision` | string | `"allow"` or `"deny"` (anything other than `"allow"` denies) |
| `scope` | string | `"once"` (this call only) or `"session"`. `"session"` additionally skips re-prompting for the same tool for the rest of the turn; the client typically also adds the tool to `session_allowed_tools` on subsequent turns. |

**Response (200):** `{"delivered": true}` — the blocked turn was signaled.
**Response (404):** `{"delivered": false}` — no matching pending request (already resolved, cancelled, or timed out).

The correlation key is `session_id` + `tool_call_id`, so multiple destructive calls within one turn (`call_0`, `call_1`, …) are answered independently. See [CLI.md → Permission modes](CLI.md).

---

### GET /events

Subscribe to the **global typed-envelope broker**. Unlike `/v1/agent` (per-request stream of one turn), `/events` is a long-lived pub/sub feed of structured envelopes from across the proxy: agent loop boundaries, tool calls, V3 stage transitions, metrics. Multiple clients can subscribe simultaneously; slow consumers drop events rather than blocking producers.

**Envelope wire format** (matches `atlas/events.py` exactly). A `stage_start` example (`duration_ms` is only set on `stage_end` / `tool_result` and the final `done`):
```json
{
  "event_id": "evt_a1b2c3d4",
  "timestamp": 1714617823.412,
  "type": "stage_start",
  "stage": "llm",
  "payload": {"turn": 1, "messages": 3}
}
```

**Event types:** `stage_start`, `stage_end`, `tool_call`, `tool_result`, `metric`, `error`, `done`. See [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md) for the full per-type payload contracts and the `{stage, detail}` → envelope translation atlas-proxy applies to v3-service SSE.

**Transport:** SSE. Each line is `data: <json>\n\n`. The server sends `: connected\n\n` immediately on subscribe and a `: heartbeat\n\n` comment every 15 s during quiet stretches to keep proxies/load-balancers from idling out the connection.

**Example:**
```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8090/events
```

Use `/events` when you want a global observability feed (a TUI pipeline pane, a metrics scraper, a debug log viewer). Use `/v1/agent` when you want to drive a specific user turn.

---

### GET /v1/calibration/status

Returns the proxy's view of whether the loaded model has compatible Geometric Lens artifacts (the verdict distilled from the lens service's `/health` payload) and whether an ASA control vector is in play. The TUI hits this on startup to render the badge next to the Pipeline pane title.

**Response shape:**

```json
{
  "lens": {
    "verdict": "supported",
    "cost_field_loaded": true,
    "cost_field_dim": 4096,
    "embed_dim": 4096,
    "gx_loaded": true,
    "cx_calibrated": true,
    "gx_calibrated": true,
    "hint": "ready"
  },
  "asa": {
    "verdict": "missing",
    "vector_path": "/models/ast_edit_steering.gguf",
    "vector_present": false,
    "hint": "no control vector at /models/ast_edit_steering.gguf — build one via `atlas asa build`"
  }
}
```

`cost_field_dim` / `embed_dim` reflect the loaded model's hidden dimension — the values differ per model.

The payload also carries a `dimensions` array — the seven status dimensions the TUI and `atlas doctor` render, each `{name, status, detail}`:

```json
{
  "dimensions": [
    {"name": "model_runtime", "status": "supported", "detail": "model served and reachable"},
    {"name": "direct_agent", "status": "supported", "detail": "model-agnostic; independent of lens/ASA state"},
    {"name": "lens_identity", "status": "supported", "detail": "cost field matches the served model's dimension"},
    {"name": "lens_scoring", "status": "supported", "detail": "C(x) + G(x) scoring available"},
    {"name": "lens_calibration", "status": "calibrated", "detail": "per-model normalization + thresholds loaded"},
    {"name": "lens_intervention", "status": "active", "detail": "threshold interventions enabled"},
    {"name": "asa", "status": "unverified", "detail": "control vector present without a matching model marker; run `atlas asa build`"}
  ]
}
```

**Verdict values:**

- **Lens:** `supported` | `no-artifacts` | `incomplete-artifacts` | `uncalibrated` | `dim-mismatch` | `unreachable`. `incomplete-artifacts` means C(x) loaded but G(x) artifacts are missing; `uncalibrated` means weights loaded without the model's calibration files (`cx_normalization.json` / `gx_thresholds.json`) — both point at `atlas lens build`.
- **ASA:** `supported` | `missing` | `unverified` | `incompatible`. `incompatible` means the control vector on disk is marked for a different model than the one selected.

**Use:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8090/v1/calibration/status | jq .
```

**Cache:** none — every call re-probes the lens service. Cost is ~50–200 ms (one HTTP round-trip to `lens/health`). TUI calls once at startup; CI / monitoring should poll no faster than every few seconds.

---

### POST /feedback

Records a human verdict on the most recent pass for a session as weighted lens training samples (`proxy/lens.go`). The TUI's `/good`, `/bad`, and per-file accept/deny review flow post here. Per-file verdicts take precedence; when a file carries no verdict, the pass-level thumbs labels it coarsely (with lower weight). A denial is recorded as a confident negative regardless of the pass thumbs.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "session_id": "tui-7f3a2c1b",
  "thumbs": "up",
  "files": [
    {"path": "app.py", "verdict": "accept"},
    {"path": "utils.py", "verdict": "deny"}
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `session_id` | string | The session whose pending pass is being rated. One pending pass per session — rating consumes it. |
| `thumbs` | string | `"up"` \| `"down"` \| `""` — pass-level verdict, applied to files without a per-file verdict |
| `files[].verdict` | string | `"accept"` \| `"deny"` — per-file verdict (review mode) |

**Response (200):**
```json
{"recorded": 2, "good": 143, "bad": 27}
```

When there is no pending pass for the session, the response is `{"recorded": 0, "note": "no pending pass for that session"}`. Samples land in the per-model training corpus that `atlas lens retrain` consumes.

---

### GET /v1/lens/training-status

Reports the collected-sample counts for the loaded model and whether a retrain is worth offering. The TUI polls this to show the "retrain available" banner.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8090/v1/lens/training-status
```

```json
{
  "model": "local-model",
  "good": 1650,
  "bad": 420,
  "total": 2070,
  "threshold": 2000,
  "retrain_available": true,
  "command": "atlas lens retrain"
}
```

`retrain_available` is true when `total >= threshold` **and** the minority class holds at least 25% of the threshold (so the corpus isn't all-positive or all-negative). The threshold defaults to 2000 and is overridable via `ATLAS_LENS_RETRAIN_MIN`.

### POST /v1/chat/completions (passthrough)

OpenAI-compatible chat completions, kept for SDK compatibility. The proxy forwards these requests to llama-server otherwise unmodified, but guarantees an explicit completion bound: `max_tokens` (or `n_predict` on `/completion`, `/completions`, `/infill`) is clamped to `ATLAS_MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` (default 8192) when missing, non-positive, or above that ceiling. A client that omits `max_tokens` therefore gets 8192, not the server default — **no agent loop, no tool calls, no V3 pipeline runs on this endpoint**. The response shape and streaming format is whatever llama-server returns natively.

**For agent turns and tool calls, use `/v1/agent`.** It carries the full structured event stream (tool calls, V3 progress, permission requests).

**Request:**
```json
{
  "model": "local-model",
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Create a Python hello world script"}
  ],
  "max_tokens": 4096,
  "temperature": 0.3,
  "stream": true
}
```

**Response:** llama-server's native OpenAI-compatible shape — `chat.completion.chunk` SSE deltas when `stream: true`, a single `chat.completion` object otherwise. The proxy adds nothing else to the payload.

> **Note:** `/models` (no `/v1/` prefix) is an alias for `/v1/models`. Any unmatched path is proxied directly to llama-server.

### Tools available to the agent loop

Defined in `proxy/tools.go`. Used by the model when responding `{"type":"tool_call","name":"<tool>","args":{...}}`.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `read_file` | Read a file and return its contents with line numbers |
| `outline_file` | Symbol outline of a file (functions/classes with line ranges and call edges, via tree-sitter). Cheaper than `read_file` for orienting in a large file. |
| `write_file` | Create a new file. **Rejected for any existing file >5 lines** (`proxy/agent.go`) — use `structural_edit` (whole function/class/element rewrite) or `edit_file` (≤10-line surgical change). Two exemptions: corrupted-looking files (prose preamble, stray markdown fences), so a self-heal full-replace is allowed there; and files the session itself created, so the agent can rewrite its own drafts. |
| `edit_file` | Apply targeted `old_str`/`new_str` edits to an existing file. Routes through V3 verification at tier 2+. A `.py` edit that introduces an unresolved direct call (would-be `NameError`) is refused by the structural gate — the error names the call and the file is not modified. The wrong tool for >10 lines of change — switch to `structural_edit`. |
| `insert_after` | Insert lines into a file after line `line` (1-based, as printed by `read_file`; `0` inserts at the top). Only the new text is supplied — there is no anchor to reproduce, which is what makes it the right tool for ADDING code rather than changing it. Requires the file to have been read, so the line numbers are current. Same syntax, structural and embedded-script gates as `edit_file`. |
| `structural_edit` | Surgical replacement of one whole named block (function, class, or HTML element). Selectors v1: Python `function:NAME` / `class:NAME` (decorator-aware), HTML `<tag>` (top-level; `<style>` inside `<head>` is NOT reachable in v1). REQUIRED for whole-function / whole-class / whole-element rewrites in existing files. Same structural gate as `edit_file` on the composed post-edit `.py` file. |
| `delete_file` | Remove a file (or an empty directory) from the workspace |
| `move_file` | Rename/move a file within the workspace (`source` → `destination`) |
| `search_files` | Regex search inside file **contents**. Returns matching lines with file paths and line numbers |
| `find_file` | Regex search by file **name** or relative path. Use to check whether a file exists. |
| `list_directory` | List files and subdirectories at a given path |
| `run_command` | Execute a shell command via bash inside the **sandbox container**. Sees `/workspace` (your project, bind-mounted rw, same path as the proxy). Has python3 + pip, node + npm, go, rust, gcc/g++, bash, pytest, tsx pre-installed. When the sandbox is unreachable the tool fails with `sandbox unavailable: ...` (exit code 1) — it never falls back to executing on the proxy host. Host execution happens only when the operator explicitly selects it via `ATLAS_VERIFY_IN=host` or `target = "host"` under `[execution]` in `.atlas/config.toml` **and** `ATLAS_TRUST_MODE=fully-trusted`. The default `trusted` silently downgrades a host request back to the sandbox, and `untrusted` refuses `run_command`/`run_background` outright. The proxy still runs `validateShellCommand` upstream as the destructive-verb gate — this entry just picks the executor. |
| `run_background` | Start a long-running process (e.g. `python app.py`, `npm run dev`) in the sandbox and return immediately with a `job_id`. The proxy detects shell `&` backgrounding through `run_command` and routes it here. |
| `tail_background` | Fetch new stdout/stderr lines from a backgrounded job by `job_id`. |
| `stop_background` | Terminate a backgrounded job by `job_id`. |

**Workspace containment.** Before any tool handler touches the filesystem, the proxy validates every path-taking argument (`path`, `source`, `destination`, `cwd`) against the workspace root (`proxy/context.go`). Paths that resolve outside the workspace — via `..`, absolute paths, or symlink components — are rejected with an error before execution, in every permission mode.

**Write deny-list.** A safety deny-list applies in every permission mode, including `yolo` (`proxy/permissions.go`): `write_file`/`edit_file` targets matching `.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, or `*credentials*` are refused, as are `run_command` invocations matching destructive patterns (`rm -rf /`, `mkfs*`, `dd if=... of=/dev/...`).

### GET /v1/models

OpenAI-compatible model list.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8090/v1/models
```

### GET /health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8090/health
```

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "inference": true,
  "lens": true,
  "lens_ready": true,
  "sandbox": true,
  "port": "8090",
  "capabilities": ["demo_raw_completion_v1"]
}
```

Always returns 200. `status` is `"ok"` when inference, the lens (`/health` and `/ready`), and the sandbox all respond healthy, `"degraded"` otherwise. `lens` reflects the lens service's informational `/health`; `lens_ready` reflects its pass/fail `/ready` gate. `capabilities` advertises optional proxy features clients can probe for.

### GET /ready

```bash
curl http://localhost:8090/ready
```

```json
{
  "ready": true,
  "inference": true,
  "lens_ready": true,
  "sandbox": true,
  "v3": true
}
```

Returns 200 only when **all** gates pass: llama-server `/health`, geometric-lens `/ready` (503s when scoring is degraded — lens weights missing, embedding-dim mismatch), sandbox `/health`, and v3-service `/health` (checked whenever a V3 URL is configured). 503 with the same body otherwise.

---

## V3 Pipeline Service (Port 8070)

Runs the full V3 code generation pipeline: probe, PlanSearch, DivSampling, Budget Forcing, Lens scoring, sandbox testing, and Phase 3 repair. Normally invoked indirectly through the proxy's `edit_file`/`write_file` tools, but the HTTP surface is stable for direct use.

### POST /v3/generate

Run the V3 pipeline for a file generation task. Streams progress events as SSE.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "file_path": "app/page.tsx",
  "baseline_code": "export default function Page() { ... }",
  "project_context": {"package.json": "{...}", "tsconfig.json": "{...}"},
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "build_command": "npx next build",
  "constraints": ["Must use Tailwind CSS", "Must be a client component"],
  "tier": 2,
  "working_dir": "/path/to/project"
}
```

All fields are optional except the task itself. `tier` defaults to 2.

**Response (SSE stream):**
```
data: {"stage": "probe", "detail": "Generating probe candidate..."}
data: {"stage": "probe_scored", "detail": "C(x)=0.72 norm=0.68 G(x)=0.81 (likely_correct)", "data": {"gx_score": 0.81, "gx_available": true, "verdict": "likely_correct"}}
data: {"stage": "phase2_allocated", "detail": "k=3 tier=standard", "data": {"k": 3, "tier": "standard", "base_tier": "standard", "gx_escalation": 0, "capped_from": "", "reason": "gated"}}
data: {"stage": "plansearch", "detail": "Generating 2 plans...", "data": {"plans": 2}}
data: {"stage": "sandbox_test", "detail": "Testing 3 candidates...", "data": {"candidates": 3}}
data: {"stage": "sandbox_pass", "detail": "Candidate 1 passed", "data": {"index": 1, "elapsed_ms": 420, "energy": 0.34}}
data: {"stage": "sandbox_done", "detail": "1/3 passed", "data": {"passed": 1, "total": 3}}
data: {"stage": "llm_start", "detail": "call #4", "data": {"call": 4, "max_tokens": 4096, "temperature": 0.7}}
data: {"stage": "token", "detail": "def "}
data: {"stage": "token", "detail": "merge_sort("}
data: {"stage": "llm_end", "detail": "245 tok · 1820ms", "data": {"call": 4, "tokens": 245, "elapsed_ms": 1820}}

event: result
data: {"code": "...", "passed": true, "phase_solved": "phase1", "candidates_tested": 3, "winning_score": 0.85, "total_tokens": 12500, "total_time_ms": 4200.0, "verification_evidence": []}

data: [DONE]
```

Each progress event has the shape `{"stage": "<name>", "detail": "<human-readable>", "data": {...}}`. The `data` object carries structured fields specific to that stage (counts, indices, timings, strategy labels) — the proxy bridge fans these out into the dedicated `v3_*` events on `/v1/agent`. Older stages without `data` enrichment still emit `stage` + `detail` only and continue to flow through `v3_progress`.

The proxy's `tools.go` bridge translates these into `v3_progress` / `v3_token` / `v3_llm_start` / `v3_llm_end` events on the `/v1/agent` stream — direct callers see the raw V3 stages.

<details>
<summary><b>All SSE stage values</b></summary>

The pipeline emits stages as it progresses. Not all stages appear in every run — the pipeline exits early when a candidate passes.

| Phase | Stages |
|-------|--------|
| **Setup / classification** | `task_type` (interactive/batch classification of the request) |
| **Probe (Phase 0)** | `probe`, `probe_light`, `probe_error`, `probe_retry`, `probe_failed`, `self_test_gen`, `self_test_done`, `self_test_error`, `self_test_skip` (interactive task — compile smoke-test instead), `self_test_verify`, `smoke_check`, `interactive_lint`, `probe_scored`, `probe_sandbox`, `probe_pass` |
| **Generation (Phase 1)** | `phase1`, `phase2` (allocation), `phase2_allocated`, `plansearch`, `plansearch_done`, `plansearch_error`, `divsampling`, `divsampling_done`, `divsampling_error` |
| **Testing / selection (Phase 2)** | `sandbox_test`, `sandbox_pass`, `sandbox_fail`, `sandbox_done`, `lens_per_step`, `lens_veto`, `structural_veto`, `call_graph_veto`, `selected` |
| **Repair (Phase 3)** | `phase3`, `pr_cot`, `pr_cot_pass`, `pr_cot_failed`, `pr_cot_error`, `refinement`, `refinement_pass`, `refinement_failed`, `refinement_error`, `refinement_verify_failed`, `refinement_skip` (remaining `ATLAS_V3_TIMEOUT` budget cannot afford one iteration — straight to fallback), `call_chain_context`, `fallback`, `fallback_all_vetoed` (every candidate was vetoed — no code returned) |
| **Verification** | `build_verify_unavailable` (build-command verification skipped — runner unreachable or command not allowed by policy) |
| **LLM streaming** | `llm_start`, `token`, `llm_end` (one bracketed group per internal LLM call — planner, candidate generation, repair, etc.) |

</details>

### POST /v3/plan

Generates a step-by-step plan for a coding task using diverse LLM sampling and heuristic scoring. Used by the proxy's agent loop to seed each turn with explicit step guidance — see [ARCHITECTURE.md § Plan Mode](ARCHITECTURE.md#plan-mode-per-turn-pre-flight) for the consumer side.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "user_message": "fix the broken index.html template",
  "working_dir": "/workspace",
  "project_context": {
    "app.py": "from flask import Flask...",
    "templates/index.html": "<!DOCTYPE html>..."
  },
  "n_candidates": 3
}
```

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `user_message` | yes | The original user request the planner must address. |
| `working_dir` | optional | Used in the planner prompt for path-context. Defaults to `""` (empty). |
| `project_context` | optional | Map of `relative_path → file_content`. Files are truncated to ~200 chars in the planner prompt. |
| `n_candidates` | optional | How many candidate plans to sample. Defaults to 3. Each is sampled at a different temperature (0.3 / 0.5 / 0.7) for diversity. |

**Response:** SSE stream of `{stage, detail, data}` events ending with `event: result\ndata: <plan-json>` and `data: [DONE]`.

Plan-pipeline stages: `plan_start`, `plan_candidate`, `plan_candidate_unparseable`, `plan_candidate_error`, `plan_candidate_scored`, `plan_selected`, `plan_failed`. Per-candidate token streaming flows under `token` / `llm_start` / `llm_end` (filtered out by the proxy bridge before reaching `/v1/agent`).

The final `event: result` payload has the shape:

```json
{
  "steps": [
    {"id": "s1", "action": "read_file", "target": "templates/index.html", "why": "inspect"},
    {"id": "s2", "action": "edit_file", "target": "templates/index.html", "why": "fix structural HTML"},
    {"id": "s3", "action": "run_command", "target": "curl http://localhost:5000/", "why": "verify"}
  ],
  "verify_step": "s3",
  "rationale": "investigate, change, verify.",
  "candidates_tested": 3,
  "winning_score": 1.0,
  "winning_index": 0,
  "reasons": ["step count 3 in range", "verify_step=s3", ...]
}
```

If all candidates fail to parse, the endpoint returns a single-step fallback (`{steps:[{action:"investigate the request and act"}], verify_step:null, winning_index:-1}`) rather than 5xx — callers can detect the fallback by `winning_index<0` or `reasons` containing "all candidates failed".

### POST /internal/structural_edit

Friendly-selector named-node replacement. Stateless transform: caller provides the file's source bytes, server parses with tree-sitter, finds the named node, returns the new full file content. The proxy reads + writes; this endpoint never touches the filesystem.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "path": "app.py",
  "source": "<full current file content>",
  "selector": "function:dashboard",
  "content": "@app.route('/dashboard')\ndef dashboard():\n    return render_template('dashboard.html')"
}
```

**Selectors v1:**
- Python: `function:NAME`, `class:NAME` — decorator-aware (replaces the `decorated_definition` wrapper when present so `@app.route(...)` lines get included in the swap)
- HTML: `<tag>` — top-level tag-name match (e.g. `<body>`, `<head>`, `<h1>`)

**Response (success):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "language": "python",
  "selector": "function:dashboard",
  "new_content": "<full new file>",
  "byte_range": [662, 881],
  "old_size": 960,
  "new_size": 852
}
```

**Response (failure):**
```json
{"success": false, "error": "selector 'function:foo' matched 0 nodes in app.py — that symbol does not exist in this file. This file defines: function:dashboard, class:UserModel. Use one of these exact selectors, or read the file to confirm."}
```

Hard rule: selector must match exactly one node. Ambiguous selectors fail with a clear error so the caller can be more specific instead of silently rewriting the wrong function.

### POST /internal/symbol_index

Resolve user-message symbol references against project source. The proxy extracts candidate symbols from the user message via regex (backticked identifiers, "the X function" patterns, dotted-path leaves), walks the working directory for `.py` files (capped at 50 files / 500 KB total), and POSTs to this endpoint. Server tree-sitter-walks each file for `function_definition` and `class_definition` nodes, returns snippets for the symbols defined in the project. Matched snippets are auto-injected into the agent's first turn so the model doesn't burn turns on `read_file`-spelunking.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "file_map": {"app.py": "<file source>", "utils.py": "..."},
  "symbols": ["dashboard", "UserModel", "validate"],
  "max_snippets": 3,
  "max_lines_per_snippet": 200
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "matched": [
    {"name": "dashboard", "kind": "function", "file": "app.py", "snippet": "@app.route('/dashboard')\ndef dashboard():\n    return ...", "n_lines": 5, "truncated": false}
  ],
  "skipped": [
    {"name": "UserModel", "reason": "not defined in scanned project files"},
    {"name": "validate", "reason": "ambiguous (3 definitions)"}
  ]
}
```

Decorator-aware (matches `structural_edit`'s behavior): a function with `@app.route(...)` returns the byte range of the wrapping `decorated_definition`, so the snippet includes the decorator line. Skips nested functions and methods inside classes — top-level definitions only in v1.

Stateless: each call rebuilds the index from the file_map. No caching.

### POST /internal/cyclomatic_complexity

McCabe cyclomatic complexity from tree-sitter syntax-tree traversal. Used by the proxy's `classifyFileTier` to *escalate* (never downgrade) the regex-based tier verdict when real branching complexity warrants the V3 pipeline.

**Request:**
```json
{"path": "app.py", "source": "<full file content>"}
```

**Response (success):**
```json
{"ok": true, "language": "python", "cyclomatic_complexity": 12}
```

**Response (unsupported / parse failed):**
```json
{"ok": false, "error": "cyclomatic_complexity v1 supports .py only (got index.html)"}
```

v1 supports Python only. Decision points counted: `if`/`elif`, `for`, `while`, `except`, `and`/`or` (short-circuit), ternary `x if cond else y`, `case` (match), and `if` filter clauses inside comprehensions.

### POST /internal/outline

Top-level function/class listing for a file — the backend of the proxy's `outline_file` tool. Uses the same decorator-aware tree-sitter walk as `structural_edit`, so any symbol the outline names is selectable by `structural_edit` with the same name. Bodies are not returned. `.py` only (`supported: false` otherwise — the proxy falls back to a regex outline).

**Request:**
```json
{"path": "app.py", "source": "<full file content>"}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "symbols": [
    {"name": "dashboard", "kind": "function", "start_line": 12, "end_line": 24}
  ],
  "supported": true
}
```

When `ATLAS_CALL_GRAPH` is enabled, each symbol additionally carries its intra-file call-graph neighborhood (`calls` / `called_by` string arrays).

### POST /internal/pycheck

Parse-check Python source without executing it (pure `compile()`). Used by the proxy's `edit_file` path to refuse writing a `.py` file the edit would break — the same gate `structural_edit` applies post-splice.

**Request:**
```json
{"path": "app.py", "source": "<file text>"}
```

**Response:** `{"ok": true}` on success, or:
```json
{"ok": false, "error": "SyntaxError at line 3: invalid syntax (offending line: def foo(:)", "line": 3}
```

### POST /internal/structural_check

Resolve every direct-identifier call in a Python source against its local defs, imports, bound names, builtins, and (optionally) supplied project symbols — without executing it. Used by the proxy's structural gate (#147) on the `.py` write paths (`edit_file`, `structural_edit`, and the `write_file` branches; under BypassV3 only the non-iterating T0/T1 direct `write_file` is excepted) to refuse content that introduces a `NameError`: a call to a name the file never binds parses fine but 500s at request time.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "path": "app.py",
  "source": "<composed post-edit file text>",
  "project_context": {"other.py": "..."}
}
```

`project_context` is optional additive leniency: top-level defs from those files are credited so a cross-file symbol is not flagged. The caller excludes the edited file's own pre-edit body (its current symbols come from `source`).

**Response:**
```json
{"ok": true, "unresolved": ["render_template"], "n_unresolved": 1, "wildcard_imports": false}
```

`ok: false` means the check could not run (tree-sitter unavailable, non-UTF-8 source) and the caller fails open. Malformed Python does not produce `ok: false` — tree-sitter parses tolerantly. `unresolved` is the complete list (no cap): the caller diffs original-vs-edited lists, and a truncated list would make that comparison unsound. `wildcard_imports: true` reports that the source contains `from x import *`; unresolved reporting is suppressed in that case (the wildcard may supply any name), so it always accompanies an empty `unresolved`.

### POST /internal/embedded_script_check

Syntax-check the JavaScript (and brace-balance the CSS) *embedded* in a file — what `/internal/pycheck` and the sandbox's `/syntax-check` are both blind to, because they see the host language only. Two carriers are handled: `<script>`/`<style>` blocks in `.html`/`.htm`/`.jinja`/`.jinja2` files, and HTML held in a **Python string literal** (the `render_template_string` shape). Backs the proxy's embedded-script gate on `edit_file`, `structural_edit` and the `write_file` branches.

**Request:**
```json
{"path": "app.py", "source": "<full file content>"}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "findings": [
    {
      "line": 121,
      "column": 86,
      "kind": "javascript",
      "where": "the <script> block inside the Python string HTML_TEMPLATE",
      "message": "unexpected `)`",
      "hint": "Nothing opened a `(` for it to close — delete the stray `)`, or add the `(` it was meant to close.",
      "text": "else if(key === 'ArrowDown' && direction !== 'UP') nextDirection = 'DOWN');"
    }
  ]
}
```

`line`/`column` are positions in the **file**, not in the extracted block, so the model can go straight to them. `kind` is `javascript` or `css`. At most 3 findings are returned, sorted by line; the caller reports the first.

`ok: false` means the check could not run (tree-sitter-javascript missing from the build, non-UTF-8 source) and the caller fails open. An unsupported extension is `ok: true` with no findings — nothing was wrong with it.

It backs a write-blocking gate, so it is conservative by construction: every ambiguous block reports nothing rather than guessing. No finding is produced when the `<script>`/`<style>` tag counts don't balance (a `</script>` inside a JS string truncates the raw text), for `<script src=...>` with no body, for a non-JS `type` (`text/template`, `application/json`, `importmap`, …), for a block still carrying template tags after `{{ }}` placeholder masking (`{% %}`, `<% %>`, multi-line placeholders), when masking those placeholders makes the block parse (the error was the template syntax), or when the Python string literal is an f-string, part of a concatenation, or contains a backslash escape (what Python renders then differs from the source bytes being parsed). Placeholder masking is length- and newline-preserving and runs only *after* the raw parse already failed, so it can only ever remove findings.

### GET /health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8070/health
# {"status": "ok", "service": "v3-pipeline"}
```

## Geometric Lens (Port 8099)

Energy-based code scoring using C(x) cost field and G(x) quality prediction, plus the pattern cache (lessons from previous sessions, served back to the agent loop). Every route is internal to the stack — the proxy and v3-service are the only callers.

> **Internal port:** The container binds uvicorn to **8099** (`geometric-lens/Dockerfile`, `EXPOSE 8099`). Docker Compose maps host 8099 → container 8099. Bare-metal launches with the same `--port 8099` default. K3s deployments expose `ATLAS_LENS_NODEPORT` (default 31144) externally.

### POST /internal/lens/gx-score

Score code using combined C(x) + G(x) energy. Single embedding extraction serves both models.

**Request:**
```json
{"text": "def merge_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    ..."}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "cx_energy": 5.2,
  "cx_normalized": 0.32,
  "cx_calibrated": true,
  "gx_score": 0.85,
  "verdict": "likely_correct",
  "gx_available": true,
  "enabled": true,
  "latency_ms": 26.4
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `cx_energy` | float | Raw cost field energy (lower = more likely correct) |
| `cx_normalized` | float | 0–1 normalized energy |
| `cx_calibrated` | bool | Whether the model's C(x) normalization calibration (`cx_normalization.json`) is loaded |
| `gx_score` | float | 0–1 probability of correctness (G(x) model) |
| `verdict` | string | `"likely_correct"`, `"uncertain"`, or `"likely_incorrect"` when thresholds are calibrated; `"uncalibrated"` when the model's `gx_thresholds.json` is missing; `"unavailable"` when the Lens is disabled or the G(x) model isn't loaded; `"error"` when evaluation failed (payload carries `error`) |
| `gx_available` | bool | Whether the G(x) model was loaded |
| `enabled` | bool | Whether Geometric Lens is enabled |
| `latency_ms` | float | Execution time in milliseconds |

When Lens is disabled, returns `enabled: false` with neutral defaults (`cx_energy: 0.0`, `gx_score: 0.5`).

**Example:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8099/internal/lens/gx-score \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "print(\"hello world\")"}'
```

### GET /health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8099/health
# {"service": "geometric-lens", "status": "healthy", "subsystems": {"sqlite": {...}, "llama_server": {...}, "lens": {...}}}
```

Always returns 200 — the endpoint is informational. `status` is `"healthy"` or `"degraded"`; the `subsystems.lens` block carries `cost_field_loaded`, `cost_field_dim`, `embed_dim`, `gx_loaded`, `cx_calibrated`, `gx_calibrated`, and the self-test result the proxy's `/v1/calibration/status` verdict is derived from.

### GET /ready

```bash
curl http://localhost:8099/ready
```

Readiness probe (`geometric-lens/main.py`). Flips to 503 when scoring is degraded (lens weights missing, embedding-dim mismatch). The atlas-proxy `/health` and `/ready` handlers both call this — `/health` is informational, `/ready` is pass/fail.

### POST /internal/patterns/context

The pattern-cache read path. Returns patterns from previous sessions whose pattern type matches the task text, scored by type match + recency + success rate, with 1-hop co-occurrence expansion. The proxy calls this in its agent-loop setup and injects the results as a `[system note]` block (see the `pattern_context_injected` event on `/v1/agent`). Served patterns get their access stats updated in the background.

**Request:**
```json
{"task": "fix the broken index.html template", "top_k": 3}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "patterns": [
    {"summary": "...", "content": "...", "type": "error_fix", "age_days": 3.2}
  ]
}
```

### Additional endpoints

These are not part of the public API — every row is consumed by other ATLAS services in-stack. They require the service token when one is configured (`secrets/service-token`, see CONFIGURATION.md `ATLAS_SERVICE_TOKEN_FILE`) and are open otherwise.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/internal/patterns/write` | POST | Write pattern data — in-stack path used by v3-service after a successful run |
| `/internal/lens/score-text` | POST | Score text (C(x) only) |
| `/internal/lens/retrain` | POST | Retrain cost field model. Returns 503 with structured guidance when the models dir is mounted read-only (the standard Compose deployment mounts it `:ro`) — run `atlas lens retrain` host-side instead. |
| `/internal/lens/score-per-step` | POST | Per-token C(x)+G(x) scoring (one forward pass over the prompt; returns per-step verdicts plus `first_off_rails_idx` and aggregates). Pass `layer: int` to score a specific intermediate residual layer (requires the per-layer hidden-states extension on llama-server). |

## Sandbox (Port 30820 → container 8020)

Isolated code execution with compilation, testing, and linting support. The container is read-only with `/workspace` bind-mounted (rw) from `ATLAS_PROJECT_DIR` — the same path the proxy sees, so paths the agent learned via `read_file`/`list_directory` work verbatim in `/shell` calls.

### POST /jobs/start

Spawn a background process and return a `job_id` immediately. Used by the proxy's `run_background` tool for long-running things like `python app.py` or `npm run dev`. The process runs in a new session group so `/jobs/{id}/stop` can kill the whole tree.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "command": "python app.py",
  "cwd": "/workspace",
  "env": {"FLASK_ENV": "development"}
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{"job_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6", "pid": 4711, "started_at": 1714617823.4}
```

**Errors:** 400 on empty command; 429 when active-job count exceeds `BG_MAX_JOBS`.

### GET /jobs/{job_id}/output

Snapshot of recent stdout/stderr plus run state. Used by the proxy's `tail_background` tool. Each stream is a ring buffer capped at `BG_MAX_LINES`; pass `?lines=N` (default 50) for the tail length.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "job_id": "a1b2c3d4e5f6",
  "running": true,
  "exit_code": null,
  "stdout": ["Listening on :5000\n", "..."],
  "stderr": [],
  "elapsed_sec": 12.4,
  "command": "python app.py"
}
```

`exit_code` is null while running, integer once exited. **404** when `job_id` is unknown.

### POST /jobs/{job_id}/stop

SIGTERM the process group, wait briefly, SIGKILL if still alive. Used by the proxy's `stop_background` tool. Returns the final stdout/stderr buffer. **404** when `job_id` is unknown.

### POST /shell

Run a shell command against the bind-mounted workspace. The proxy's `run_command` tool routes here so the agent's verification commands (`pytest`, `python app.py`, `npm run build`, `curl`, etc.) execute against the user's actual files with the full language matrix the proxy lacks.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "command": "cd flask_app && pip install -q -r requirements.txt && python app.py",
  "cwd": "/workspace",
  "timeout": 30,
  "env": {"FLASK_ENV": "development"}
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `command` | string | (required) | Shell command run via `bash -c`. |
| `cwd` | string | `/workspace` | Absolute path inside the container. **Must be under `/workspace`** — `/etc`, `/`, etc. are rejected with HTTP 400. The path must already exist (no auto-mkdir). |
| `timeout` | int | 30 | Max execution time in seconds. Capped at `MAX_EXECUTION_TIME` (60s in-code default; the Compose stack sets it to 300 via `ATLAS_SANDBOX_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME`, matching the proxy's `run_command` cap). |
| `env` | object | null | Extra env vars merged on top of the container's environment. |
| `files` | object | null | Optional map of `relative-path → content`. When present, `/shell` copies a bounded snapshot of the workspace into `/tmp`, overlays these files, runs the command there, then deletes the snapshot. Used by V3 build verification to test a candidate without writing it into the real bind-mounted project. |

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "stdout": "Hello World\n",
  "stderr": "",
  "exit_code": 0,
  "elapsed_ms": 78
}
```

`success` is `exit_code == 0`. Stdout is truncated to its last 4000 chars and stderr to its last 2000 server-side; the proxy's `run_command` bridge applies its own caps (stdout 8000 / stderr 4000) on top. State is **not** persistent between calls — each call is its own subprocess. To preserve state (e.g. an installed pip package) chain commands with `&&` in a single call, or rely on a project venv that survives across calls because it lives on the bind-mounted workspace.

The proxy's destructive-verb gate (`validateShellCommand`) blocks catastrophic commands — fork bombs, `rm -rf /`-class whole-project wipes, `find … -delete` / `-exec rm` from a search root, `dd`/`mkfs`/`wipefs` against block devices — and unwraps one `bash -c "…"` / `eval "…"` layer so the inner command is checked too, *before* the call ever reaches `/shell`. Ordinary `mv`, `cp`, and targeted `rm` of specific files are allowed. This endpoint is the executor, not the gate.

### POST /execute

Execute code in an isolated environment.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "code": "from utils import greet\nprint(greet('world'))",
  "language": "python",
  "test_code": null,
  "requirements": null,
  "timeout": 30,
  "files": {"utils.py": "def greet(name): return f'hi {name}'"}
}
```

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `code` | string | (required) | Code to execute |
| `language` | string | `"python"` | Target language (see supported list below) |
| `test_code` | string | null | Optional test code (e.g. pytest assertions) |
| `requirements` | string[] | null | Python packages to pip install before execution |
| `timeout` | int | 30 | Max execution time in seconds (capped at `MAX_EXECUTION_TIME`) |
| `files` | object | null | Map of `relative-path → file-content` written into the workspace before execution. Use to ship multi-file project context (e.g. modules the candidate imports). Path traversal (`..`, absolute paths, symlink components) is rejected. |
| `stdin` | string | null | Optional standard input piped to the run step. When null the process inherits the server's stdin. |

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "compile_success": true,
  "tests_run": 1,
  "tests_passed": 1,
  "lint_score": 8.5,
  "stdout": "hello from sandbox\n",
  "stderr": "",
  "error_type": null,
  "error_message": null,
  "execution_time_ms": 45
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `success` | bool | Overall pass/fail |
| `compile_success` | bool | Whether compilation succeeded (always true for interpreted languages) |
| `tests_run` | int | Number of tests executed |
| `tests_passed` | int | Number of tests that passed |
| `lint_score` | float? | Pylint score 0–10 (Python only, null for other languages) |
| `stdout` | string | Stdout output (truncated to last 4000 chars) |
| `stderr` | string | Stderr output (truncated to last 2000 chars) |
| `error_type` | string? | Error classification (e.g. `SyntaxError`, `CompileError`, `Timeout`, `ImportError`) |
| `error_message` | string? | First 500 chars of error details |
| `execution_time_ms` | int | Execution time in milliseconds |

### POST /syntax-check

**Request:**
```json
{
  "code": "def foo(:\n    pass",
  "language": "python",
  "filename": "main.py"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "valid": false,
  "errors": ["SyntaxError: invalid syntax (line 1)"],
  "language": "python",
  "check_time_ms": 12
}
```

## llama-server (Port 8080)

Standard llama.cpp server API. See [llama.cpp documentation](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/blob/master/tools/server/README.md).

### POST /v1/chat/completions

OpenAI-compatible chat completions with `response_format` support for grammar-constrained JSON output.

**Example:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "local-model",
    "messages": [{"role":"user","content":"Say hello"}],
    "max_tokens": 50,
    "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}
  }'
```

### POST /completion

Raw completion endpoint (no chat template). Used internally by the benchmark runner.

### POST /embedding

Generate embeddings for input text. Used by Geometric Lens for C(x)/G(x) scoring.

#### ATLAS extension: per-layer residual hidden states

`/embedding` and `/embeddings` (the native paths — *not* `/v1/embeddings`)
accept an optional `layers` parameter that returns the post-block residual
stream at the requested transformer layers, in addition to the standard
final-layer embedding. Used by the Geometric Lens (lens-as-PRM scoring)
and the Qwen-Scope SAE service.

**Request:**

```json
{
  "content": "...",
  "layers": [8, 16, 24]
}
```

- `layers` (optional): array of transformer block indices. Each must be
  in `[0, n_layer)`. Maximum 8 entries per request (memory bound).
  Omit for back-compat (response shape is unchanged).
- Rejected on `/v1/embeddings` — the OAI-compat path doesn't expose this
  extension. Use `/embedding` or `/embeddings` instead.

**Response (when `layers` is set):**

```json
[{
  "index": 0,
  "embedding": [...],
  "hidden_states": {
    "8":  "<base64 float32, row-major n_tokens × hidden_dim>",
    "16": "...",
    "24": "..."
  },
  "hidden_states_n_tokens": 84,
  "hidden_states_dim":      4096,
  "hidden_states_dtype":    "float32",
  "hidden_states_encoding": "base64"
}]
```

The base64-decoded buffer is float32 little-endian, row-major
`[n_tokens][hidden_dim]`. A client decodes with
`np.frombuffer(b64decode(s), dtype='<f4').reshape(n_tokens, hidden_dim)`.

**Decode example (Python):**

```python
import base64, numpy as np, requests
r = requests.post("http://llama-server:8080/embedding", json={
    "content": "def fib(n): return n if n<2 else fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)",
    "layers":  [8, 16, 24],
}).json()[0]
n, d = r["hidden_states_n_tokens"], r["hidden_states_dim"]
hs = {int(k): np.frombuffer(base64.b64decode(v), dtype="<f4").reshape(n, d)
      for k, v in r["hidden_states"].items()}
# hs[16].shape == (n_tokens, 4096)
```

**Tap point:** post-block residual stream (`l_out-{N}` in llama.cpp's
ggml graph). Verified against Qwen3.5-9B-Q6_K (architecture `qwen35`)
and matches the hook point Qwen-Scope SAEs are trained on. Same tensor
name regardless of whether the block is attention-based or
DeltaNet/SSM-based, so all 32 layers of Qwen3.5-9B are accessible.

**Wire format rationale:** base64 over JSON arrays. Empirically a single
layer of 84 tokens × 4096 dims is 1.4 MiB raw float32, 1.8 MiB as base64,
or 7 MiB as a JSON array of floats — and lens-as-PRM scoring fires this every N tokens
during generation. JSON would push 50+ MiB per multi-layer scoring call;
base64 keeps it manageable.

### GET /health

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
# {"status":"ok"}
```

## Versioning and error codes

`GET /version` returns the API version, the SSE protocol version, and
the full error-code set:

```json
{"api_version": "1.0.0", "protocol_version": 1, "error_codes": [...]}
```

`api_version` follows semver (minor = additive, major = breaking).
Error responses use a stable envelope — **switch on `error` (a closed
code set), never on `detail`** (the human message may change):

```json
{"error": "unauthorized", "detail": "...", "api_version": "1.0.0"}
```

Codes: `unauthorized`, `invalid_input`, `unsupported_operation`,
`dependency_unavailable`, `resource_limit`, `internal_error` — the
closed set is exactly what live `writeError` calls emit
(`AllErrorCodes` in `proxy/main.go`). Machine-readable schemas live in `docs/schemas/`: the full
OpenAPI 3.1 spec for this surface (`proxy_openapi.yaml`, parity-checked
against the registered routes in CI) plus JSON Schemas for the error and
SSE envelopes.

## Building a non-TUI client

A minimal client needs four things (plus one header):

0. **Send the service token** on every request when the installation
   has one (`secrets/service-token`, generated by `atlas init`):
   `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Without it, all proxy routes except
   `/health`, `/ready`, and `/version` return 401 on token-bearing
   installs. Reading the file at startup is enough — rotation restarts
   the stack.

1. **POST `/v1/agent`** with `{message, working_dir, mode, session_id}` and parse the SSE stream. See the Python example above.
2. **Answer `permission_request` events.** In `default`/`accept-edits` mode the turn pauses on destructive tools until you **POST `/v1/permission`** with `{session_id, tool_call_id, decision:"allow"|"deny", scope:"once"|"session"}` (echo `tool_call_id` from the event). Unanswered requests deny after `ATLAS_PERMISSION_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 600s). Unattended clients skip this by using `mode:"yolo"` or pre-approving tools via `session_allowed_tools`.
3. **POST `/cancel`** with `{session_id}` when the user wants to abort.
4. *(Optional)* **GET `/events`** in a background goroutine/thread for the global typed-envelope feed if you want a pipeline-progress sidebar.

The TUI ([atlas tui](CLI.md)) is a Go reference implementation — its `model.go`/`events.go` show how to handle every event type, and `panes.go` shows one approach to rendering them. Browse `tui/` in the repo for a complete worked example.

This document and the TUI source are the canonical reference for building a client.
