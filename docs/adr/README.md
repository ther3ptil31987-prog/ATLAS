# Architecture Decision Records

An ADR records a significant decision: its context, the decision, and its
consequences. Significant means what [GOVERNANCE](../../GOVERNANCE.md#proposals-rfc--adr--epic)
lists: architecture changes, new dependencies, security-model changes,
release policy, support-matrix changes, and any breaking change. Each one
starts as an **RFC issue**.

## Status

The line under the title gives the status, the date, and the RFC issue:

```
Status: Proposed. RFC: #123
Status: Accepted 2026-10. RFC: #123
Status: Superseded by 0012 (2026-11)
```

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Proposed | Under discussion. The RFC's comment period is open, and the ADR is a pull request. |
| Accepted | Decided. The ADR is merged and the RFC issue became an Epic. |
| Superseded by NNNN | Replaced by a later ADR, which names this one. |

An accepted ADR isn't rewritten. A later decision gets a new ADR that
references it. Smaller changes are added to the status line with a date:
*narrowed by NNNN* (a later ADR limits part of it), *revised* (a dated
correction, explained in the text), or *retired* (the thing it governs was
removed).

## Writing one

1. Open the **RFC** issue form. The comment period is 7 days.
2. For line-by-line review, open a pull request adding
   `docs/adr/NNNN-short-title.md`, with the next free number and status
   Proposed.
3. Use three sections: **Context**, **Decision**, **Consequences**.
4. After a maintainer accepts the RFC, set the status to Accepted with the
   month and merge.
