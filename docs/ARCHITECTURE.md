# ATLAS Architecture

System architecture for ATLAS V3.1.6. Two-layer design: an outer agent loop handles tool-call orchestration, and an inner V3 pipeline generates diverse code candidates with build verification and energy-based selection.

Services run as containers via Docker Compose (recommended) or as local processes via the `atlas` launcher. Only llama-server uses the GPU. Everything else runs on CPU.

The chat front-end is the **atlas-tui** (Bubbletea): a native Go terminal UI consuming `/v1/agent` (per-turn chat SSE) and `/events` (global typed-envelope feed for the pipeline pane). Launch with `atlas` (interactive default) or `atlas tui` (explicit). Pipeline pane shows V3 stages live; chat pane renders assistant markdown via glamour; slash commands `/add /diff /commit /run` etc. handle local file context and shell-out. Mode-aware input (chat / `!bash` / `/slash`) with a hint dropdown.

Third-party clients that want tool calls + V3 pipeline target `/v1/agent` directly; `/v1/chat/completions` is a passthrough to llama-server (see §3). The contract is documented in [API.md](API.md).

### 1.1 Supported Accelerators

llama-server is the only GPU-using service; every other ATLAS service runs on CPU (proxy is Go, v3-service / geometric-lens / sandbox are Python). That keeps the multi-backend surface small — adding a new accelerator means a new Dockerfile + an entrypoint env-var branch, not changes to the pipeline.

| Backend | Status (V3.1.x) | Image / build path | Compose override | Tested cards |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CUDA** (NVIDIA) | Supported (since V3.1.0) | `inference/Dockerfile.v31` → `atlas-llama` | (default) | RTX 5060 Ti 16GB (canonical). The published image is compiled for Blackwell (compute capability 12.0/12.1) only; earlier generations need a local rebuild — see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) |
| **ROCm / HIP** (AMD) | Community-tested (since V3.1.1) | `inference/Dockerfile.rocm` → `atlas-llama-rocm`, built on the host (`pull_policy: build`; no GHCR image) | `docker-compose.rocm.yml` | RX 7900 XTX (community smoke-test, GH #26) |
| **Metal** (Apple Silicon) | Supported ([#32](https://github.com/inferstep/ATLAS/issues/32)) | Hybrid: native llama-server (Metal) + Docker for the rest (macOS can't passthrough GPU to containers) | `docker-compose.macos.yml` | M-series; Q4_K_M on ≤16 GB, Q6_K on ≥24 GB unified |
| **Vulkan** (cross-vendor fallback) | Preview | `inference/Dockerfile.vulkan` → `atlas-llama-vulkan` | `docker-compose.vulkan.yml` | lavapipe CPU boot path (smoke-tested); no real-GPU validation yet |
| **SYCL** (Intel Arc) | Roadmap — Intel Arc uses `vulkan` today | TBD | TBD | — |

**Backend selection happens at install time, not runtime.** `atlas init` runs `tier.detect_gpu()` (see `atlas/commands/tier.py`), picks the largest-VRAM GPU across all detected vendors (override with `ATLAS_GPU_VENDOR` / `ATLAS_GPU_INDEX`), and writes `ATLAS_BACKEND={cuda|rocm|metal|vulkan}` into `.env`. Detection resolves to the packaged native backend when one exists: CUDA for NVIDIA, ROCm for AMD on x86_64, the hybrid Metal path on macOS. When no native backend is packaged for the host (Intel Arc, AMD on arm64, unrecognized vendors), the wizard offers the Vulkan universal fallback (default-yes): one image covers AMD, Intel, Adreno, MoltenVK, and the lavapipe CPU rasterizer, at roughly 20–40% below a tuned native backend. It refuses — rather than writing a `.env` that won't boot — only when nothing usable exists. Each backend has its own image — CUDA and Vulkan prebuilt on GHCR, ROCm compiled on the AMD host at first `up` — so users don't run a fat image that ships every backend's libraries.

**Bring-your-own-model surface (V3.1.1).** `atlas lens check` is a cheap pre-flight against a running llama-server that reports whether the loaded model is Lens-compatible. `atlas lens build --samples <path>` wraps `geometric-lens/geometric_lens/training.py` to train fresh C(x) (`cost_field.pt`) **and** G(x) (XGBoost) artifacts at the model's native embedding dim. Together they let users swap in non-default GGUFs without forking the lens code — the C(x) constructor accepts arbitrary `input_dim`, so the only thing that changes per-model is the trained weights. See [CLI.md § atlas lens](CLI.md#atlas-lens) for the user-facing flow; `atlas lens publish` (or the combined `atlas publish`) uploads the artifacts to HuggingFace and opens the registry PR that pins their hashes.

**What's vendor-agnostic** (works on every backend): grammar-constrained JSON, self-embeddings (`/embedding`), per-layer hidden states, ASA control vectors (loaded by llama.cpp's `control_vector_load` regardless of backend), KV cache quantization, the entire outer agent loop, V3 pipeline, Geometric Lens, and sandbox.

**What differs per backend:**
- **Flash attention.** CUDA + ROCm: full support. Metal: limited (llama.cpp Metal backend supports flash-attn for some head sizes; defaults to off if unsupported). Vulkan: driver-dependent.
- **Pinned host memory.** `GGML_CUDA_NO_PINNED` applies to CUDA + ROCm (HIP mirrors the CUDA path at the GGML compat layer). Metal/Vulkan don't use the CUDA/HIP pinning path.
- **Multi-GPU + tensor parallelism.** V1 supports single-GPU only on every backend; multi-GPU is GH #34, not bound to a specific vendor.
- **Apple unified memory.** macOS shares GPU+system memory; "VRAM" math is actually "16 GB total minus OS + apps." See §7.

The K3s deployment path (`scripts/install.sh`, manifests in `templates/`) is CUDA-only as of V3.1.1 — ROCm K8s recipe is deferred to the V3.2 infra list (needs `/dev/kfd` + `/dev/dri` hostPath mounts and `render`/`video` group membership, the cluster-level equivalents of `docker-compose.rocm.yml`).

## 2. Services

| Service | Port | Language | Purpose |
|---------|------|----------|---------|
| **llama-server** | 8080 | C++ (llama.cpp) | LLM inference (CUDA / ROCm / Metal / Vulkan; SYCL on roadmap — see §1.1), grammar-constrained JSON, self-embeddings, per-layer residual hidden states |
| **atlas-proxy** | 8090 | Go | Agent loop, tool-call routing, tier classification, `/v1/agent` SSE, `/events` typed SSE, `/cancel`. `/v1/chat/completions` forwards to llama-server with only a `max_tokens` clamp applied (see API.md). |
| **atlas-tui** | (client) | Go | Bubbletea TUI; consumes `/events` and `/v1/agent` SSE streams. |
| **v3-service** | 8070 | Python | V3 pipeline HTTP wrapper (PlanSearch, DivSampling, PR-CoT, etc.) |
| **geometric-lens** | 8099 | Python (FastAPI) | Internal `/internal/*` scoring service: C(x) energy scoring, G(x) XGBoost quality prediction, per-step scoring, plus the pattern cache (read + write); owns the SQLite state store (`SQLITE_DB_PATH` on the `lens-state` volume) backing the pattern cache and co-occurrence graph |
| **sandbox** | 30820 (host) / 8020 (container) | Python (FastAPI) | Isolated code execution, compilation, linting, test running |

---

## 3. atlas-proxy (Outer Layer)

The proxy is the entry point for chat front-ends. It accepts user messages on `/v1/agent` (typed event stream — what the TUI uses) and runs an internal agent loop that calls llama-server, parses tool calls, executes them, and streams events back. The `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint is a transparent passthrough to llama-server; it is kept for SDK compatibility and does not run the agent loop. See [API.md](API.md) for the full event-type catalogue.

The proxy is 12 Go files, one concern each:

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| `main.go` | HTTP server, routes, auth, passthrough, error envelope, private-value log filter |
| `agent.go` | The agent loop: turn state, LLM calls, plan generation, pattern-context injection, stuck-loop breakers |
| `tools.go` | The 14 tool definitions + executors, tier classification, tool-call grammar |
| `gates.go` | Honesty/plan gates: claim-check, structural, syntax, embedded-script, plan-adherence, plan-reminder, asset lint |
| `detectors.go` | Stuck-pattern detectors: tool repetition, reasoning repetition, traceback localization |
| `context.go` | Context enrichment: symbol index, project scan, workspace containment, session file manifest |
| `permissions.go` | Permission gate (`/v1/permission`), trust mode, hard-blocked patterns |
| `lens.go` | Lens scoring calls, lens-sample banking (`/feedback`), calibration status |
| `guardrails.go` | Per-tool steering guards (shrinkage, missing-command/module steers, doctype strip) |
| `events.go` | Typed-envelope broker (`/events`) and SSE plumbing |
| `v3_bridge.go` | SSE client for v3-service `/v3/generate` + `/v3/plan` |
| `types.go` | Shared types, tiers, turn caps |

```

### Grammar Enforcement

Every model output is constrained toward one of three valid JSON shapes:

```json
{"type": "tool_call", "name": "<tool_name>", "args": {...}}
{"type": "text", "content": "<message>"}
{"type": "done", "summary": "<summary>"}
```

In the default `strict` mode the proxy sends a full JSON schema — `oneOf` with `additionalProperties: false`, tool names enumerated from the registry — which llama-server enforces as a grammar during token generation. Grammar constraints make malformed output rare, not impossible: `ATLAS_GRAMMAR_MODE=loose` sends `{"type":"json_object"}` only (valid JSON, no shape enforcement — some models require it), and the response token cap can truncate mid-JSON. The proxy treats parsing as fallible — it recovers JSON from prose/`reasoning_content`, detects truncated tool args before execution, feeds targeted parse-failure descriptions back, and breaks the loop after three consecutive failures.

### Tools

15 tools registered in `proxy/tools.go`:

| Tool | Purpose | Read-only |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `read_file` | Read file contents (with optional offset/limit) | Yes |
| `outline_file` | List a file's top-level functions/classes with line ranges, no bodies (tree-sitter for `.py`, best-effort scan otherwise). The surgical-read entry point: outline first, then `read_file` with offset/limit | Yes |
| `write_file` | Create a NEW file (rejected for existing files >5 lines — see safety limits) | No |
| `edit_file` | Surgical inline string replacement (old_str/new_str) for ≤10-line changes | No |
| `insert_after` | Insert new lines after a given line number — the line numbers `read_file` prints. For ADDING code (a branch, function, import) where nothing existing changes: there is no `old_str` to reproduce, which is the step that fails on long spans | No |
| `structural_edit` | Whole-function/class/HTML-element rewrite via tree-sitter selector (`function:NAME`, `class:NAME`, `<tag>`); REQUIRED over edit_file for whole-node swaps. GH #39, .py/.html/.htm only in v1 | No |
| `delete_file` | Delete file or empty directory (forces loop exit after) | No |
| `move_file` | Move or rename a file within the workspace (e.g. `index.html` → `templates/`). Pure relocation — bypasses the V3/surgical-edit gate, refuses to clobber an existing destination. The supported path for "reorganize the files" since shell `mv`/`cp` are refused | No |
| `find_file` | Regex search by file **name** / path (cheap existence + locate). Distinct from `search_files` which greps inside file contents. | Yes |
| `search_files` | Regex search across file contents (max 200 matches, skips .git/node_modules) | Yes |
| `list_directory` | List directory contents with type and size | Yes |
| `run_command` | Execute shell command via sandbox container; 5 min timeout cap | No |
| `run_background` | Start a long-running process (e.g. `python app.py`) in the sandbox; returns a `job_id` immediately | No |
| `tail_background` | Fetch new stdout/stderr from a backgrounded job by `job_id` | Yes |
| `stop_background` | SIGTERM/SIGKILL a backgrounded job by `job_id` | No |

### Tool-selection bias mitigations

A measured reference deployment showed a bias toward `edit_file` over
`structural_edit` even when `structural_edit` was correct (BiasBusters arxiv 2510.00307 —
embeddings of nearby tool names compete; descriptions matter more than names).
Four model-independent defenses compose in the proxy:

1. **Description rewrite** (`proxy/tools.go`). edit_file's description
   warns against whole-file/whole-function use; structural_edit's description
   says REQUIRED for >10-line / whole-node swaps; write_file's says
   NEW files only.
2. **Conditional GBNF grammar** (`proxy/tools.go`,
   `proxy/agent.go:stepExclusions`). When a write_file is rejected on
   an existing .py/.html/.htm file >5 lines, the next LLM call is
   constrained by a GBNF grammar that bans edit_file and write_file
   from the tool-name production. The model physically cannot emit
   them. Restriction expires after one decision.
3. **Per-step tool-list filter** (same trigger). An ephemeral
   `[system note]` user message is injected reminding the model that
   structural_edit is the only structural-edit tool for this step.
4. **ASA steering vectors** (`geometric-lens/asa_calibration/`).
   Activation steering shifts the residual-stream distribution upstream
   so structural_edit is preferred even on first-attempt decisions before any
   rejection has fired. Auto-loaded by `inference/entrypoint-v3.1.sh`
   from `/models/ast_edit_steering.gguf` only when its `.model` sidecar
   matches the selected model—always-on after a compatible build via the workflow
   in `geometric-lens/asa_calibration/README.md`. Override path/scale/
   layer-range via `ATLAS_CONTROL_VECTOR*` env vars.

   **Per-model coupling.** Each ASA vector is trained
   against a specific model's residual-stream geometry. No cross-model
   fallback is safe. `atlas asa check` verifies the `.model` sidecar, probes
   the loaded embedding dimension, parses GGUF layer metadata, and reports
   `compat` / `needs-build` / `incompatible`. `atlas asa build` derives the
   extraction layer from the loaded model, writes the vector and marker, and
   runs inside the lens container. `atlas asa publish` refuses missing or
   mismatched markers before upload. See [CLI.md § atlas asa](CLI.md#atlas-asa).

### Per-File Tier Classification

Each `write_file`/`edit_file` call is classified independently:

| Tier | Max Turns | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| T0 (Conversational) | 5 | Text response only |
| T1 (Simple) | 0 (uncapped) | Direct write — no V3 overhead |
| T2 (Feature) | 0 (uncapped) | V3 pipeline fires |
| T3 (Hard) | 0 (uncapped) | V3 pipeline fires |

The two columns above belong to two different classifiers, and the table reads as one only by coincidence. **Turns** comes from the message tier (`proxy/agent.go:classifyAgentTier`), which scores what the user typed. **Behavior** comes from the file tier (`proxy/tools.go:classifyFileTier`), which scores the file being edited and is what actually gates V3 — the message tier is forwarded to v3-service but only lands in a log line.

Because the turn cap is the same for T1/T2/T3, the message tier has exactly one decision to make: conversational or not. T0 caps at 5 turns and skips Plan Mode; every other value behaves identically. It therefore requires positive evidence to call something conversational — a sub-12-character greeting or a question shape — and treats everything else as work. The asymmetry is deliberate: misreading conversation as work costs one wasted planner call, while misreading work as conversation caps a real request at 5 turns and fails it.

Tier caps are 0 (uncapped); the detector stack inside the loop decides when to break: lens regression (`agent_lens_intervention`), reasoning repetition (`agent_reasoning_intervention`), tool-call repetition (`agent_repeat_intervention`), path-aware error breaker, done-without-action gate, claim-check gate, plan adherence threshold, and the empty-response fallback. Operators can override with `ATLAS_MAX_TURNS=<n>` for one-off "fix the entire app" prompts — see `proxy/types.go::envOverrideMaxTurns`.

Two of those gates decide whether to fire from what the run observed rather than from how the request was worded, because request wording is an open vocabulary that no list completes:

- **Verification gate** — blocks `done` when the user asked for a repair, *or* when a test or build command actually exited non-zero and nothing has passed since. The second condition catches a failing test the model introduced on its own, which no reading of the user's message could have predicted.
- **Done-without-action gate** — blocks `done` when the request carries explicit action wording, *or* when the model opened the project on a non-conversational message and nothing landed on disk. That covers verbs absent from the intent list (`remove the debug logging` matches none of them), while questions stay exempt: they are conversational, and answering one by reading files and writing nothing is correct.

Classifier in `proxy/tools.go` (`classifyFileTier`); logic-pattern matcher in the same file (`hasLogicIndicators`).

**Always T1 (direct write):**
- Config files matched by name (e.g. `package.json`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, `dockerfile`, `docker-compose.*`)
- Data files by extension (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.toml`, `.csv`, `.xml`, `.env`)
- Style files (`.css`, `.scss`, `.less`)
- Documentation (`.md`, `.txt`, `.rst`) and shell scripts (`.sh`, `.bash`)
- Trivially-tiny files under **10 lines** (V3 has nothing to meaningfully diversify on at that size)
- Unknown extensions with no logic indicators

The exact config-file list and extension sets live in `proxy/tools.go:classifyFileTier`.

**T2 (V3 pipeline)** — file qualifies if it's ≥10 lines AND either:
- `hasLogicIndicators(content)` returns true — **2+ matches** across pattern families covering function/method definitions, control flow, error handling, Flask/FastAPI/Django routing, Express/Node API, React state/data, validation, database calls, JSX/React component patterns, and imports (the literal token list is in `proxy/tools.go:hasLogicIndicators`)
- OR the file has a recognized source-code / markup extension (`.py`, `.go`, `.rs`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.html`, `.htm`, …) and no logic indicators fired — gets the benefit of the doubt at T2 (covers minimal-but-real files like a 12-line component shell)

**T3 (Hard)** — currently classifier never emits T3 by itself; the cyclomatic-complexity refiner (`refineTierWithCC` via GH #39 point 2's `/internal/cyclomatic_complexity`) *escalates* on McCabe CC: to T2 at CC ≥ 8 (including from T1) and to T3 at CC ≥ 16. Never downgrades.

### Plan Mode (per-turn pre-flight)

Plan mode is a pre-flight planning step that runs once per agent turn before the first tool call: the planner samples candidate plans, scores them heuristically, and renders the winner into the system prompt, where an adherence gate auto-revises when the model thrashes off-plan. It cuts discovery thrashing and blocks no-evidence `done` by guarding on the plan's verify step.

See [PLAN_MODE.md](PLAN_MODE.md) for the full flow, components, tunables, skip conditions, cost, and testing matrix.

### Safety Limits

Operator-facing limits and the knobs that tune them. Internal steering guards (traceback localization, missing-module/missing-command/broken-inline-script/case-mismatch steers, symbol grounding, no-op/empty-content/syntax gates, doctype strip) live in `proxy/guardrails.go` and `proxy/agent.go`; the structural gate (refuses a `.py` write that introduces an unresolved direct call — a would-be `NameError` — on `edit_file`, `structural_edit`, and every `write_file` branch; under BypassV3 only the non-iterating T0/T1 direct `write_file` skips it, so the demo baseline pane shows the raw model, while the edit paths and the iteration fast-path stay gated in all modes) lives in `proxy/gates.go`. The embedded-script gate lives there too: it parses the JavaScript (and brace-balances the CSS) inside `<script>`/`<style>` blocks — in `.html`/`.htm`/`.jinja`/`.jinja2` files **and inside Python string literals**, the `render_template_string` shape — through v3-service `POST /internal/embedded_script_check`, and refuses a change that newly breaks it. It exists because every other gate is structurally blind to that code: the 2026-08-01 dogfooding session left a stray `)` in a Flask app's inline `<script>`, and the Python compiled, the server started and `curl /` returned 200, so the verification gate passed and `done` was accepted while the page was dead in the browser. Same healthy→broken rule as the syntax gate (a still-broken repair-in-progress is allowed) and the same fail-soft posture: an unreachable service, a missing grammar or an ambiguous block (template statement tags, `<script src>`, a non-JS `type`, an escaped Python string) yields no finding, never a blocked write. The missing-command steer fires on `command not found` shell errors: the sandbox is non-root on a read-only base, so absent binaries can never be apt-installed at runtime — the steer says so and points at pip-installable equivalents or the preinstalled toolchains instead of letting the model re-run into the repetition breaker. The broken-inline-script steer fires when a `python -c` verification one-liner fails with a SyntaxError in the `-c` argument itself (a multi-statement `def`/`for` body jammed onto one line): the solution file may be correct while only the verify command is malformed, so it directs the model to move the test into a `.py` file rather than re-run the unparseable one-liner.

**Pattern-context injection.** During run setup — next to the symbol-index injection — the proxy asks the lens pattern-cache reader (`POST /internal/patterns/context`) for lessons from previous sessions whose pattern type matches the user message, and injects the top ≤3 as one `[system note]` block (hard 600-char cap). Strictly fail-soft: any error, timeout, or empty result skips the block, so the lens being down never costs a turn. Emits `pattern_context_injected` on the `/v1/agent` stream. `fetchPatternContext` in `proxy/agent.go`; the serving side is § 5 → [Pattern cache](#pattern-cache).

**Fast-path writes during active iteration.** V3 fires on the *first* write of a T2+ file (baseline generation). But once the model has written a file and just saw it fail a run, the next write is a targeted fix in an edit-test-fix loop — it skips V3 (still syntax- and structural-gated) and writes directly. V3's full pipeline is multi-minute per call and, on a file mid-debug, frequently completes without a usable result and falls back anyway; paying that latency per iteration throttles the loop to a handful of cycles. The fast-path keys off `SessionWrites[path]` plus a failed most-recent run referencing the file.

**Iteration vs. repetition.** The loop breakers distinguish a model *iterating toward a fix* from one *spinning*. `write_file` repetition is keyed on the target path **plus a whitespace-stripped content fingerprint**: reasserting the same draft collides and counts toward the threshold, but rewriting a file with materially different content (fixing successive compiler errors) produces distinct signatures and is not counted. When repetition *is* detected, the breaker **steers before it kills** — the first detection injects a corrective `[system note]` and the loop continues; only a second detection (the model repeated after seeing the nudge) ends the session. This replaced an immediate hard-stop that terminated legitimate iteration with the solution on disk but unverified.

| Limit | Value | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Conversation trim | Sliding window sized to the slot: keep system + most-recent-user-instruction + the active file's content + as many trailing messages as fit `per-slot context − ATLAS_MAX_TOKENS − 2048 − slot/8` (the `slot/8` term is tokenizer slack: the chars/4 estimate under-counts dense code/JSON). The pinned instruction and file content are counted against the budget, not just re-injected. Floor: keep 8; hard ceiling via `ATLAS_AGENT_HISTORY_BUDGET`. If llama-server still rejects the prompt as over-context, the loop force-trims to the minimum window and retries once instead of killing the session | Prevent context overflow without dropping the file under edit |
| Redundant-read short-circuit | Whole-file re-read of an unchanged file returns an "already in context" pointer only while the content is still live; otherwise the full file is re-served (`ATLAS_DEDUP_READS=0` disables) | Avoid re-encoding an unchanged file every turn without the model editing blind |
| V3 interactive wall-clock cap | Single V3 pipeline call capped at `ATLAS_V3_TIMEOUT` (default 180s); on timeout the proxy falls back to the model's syntax- and structural-gated content (`0` disables) | Keep an interactive session responsive under a long repair stall |
| Per-turn reasoning budget | Cut the stream after ~6144 reasoning tokens (`ATLAS_REASONING_BUDGET`, 0 disables); recovery extracts an embedded tool_call or re-prompts | Bound reasoning spirals |
| write_file for existing files | Reject if file > 5 lines; on .py/.html/.htm the per-step grammar gate steers to `structural_edit` | Force surgical (`edit_file`) or whole-node (`structural_edit`) edits |
| Suspicious-shrinkage guard | Reject `structural_edit`/`edit_file` when `oldSize >= 100B` and `newSize < 64B` (`proxy/guardrails.go::validateNotSuspiciouslyShrunk`) | Catch destructive stub rewrites before they hit disk |
| structural_edit runaway-content guard | Reject when `content` > 8 KB AND > 4× the file size | Catch reasoning-leak blobs emitted as the replacement node |
| Error loop breaker | 3 consecutive failures | Stop runaway failure cycles |
| Exploration budget | Nudge at 4 consecutive read-only calls; escalated nudge at 5+. Reads always execute — the nudge steers the *next* turn toward a write | Push the model to write instead of exploring indefinitely |
| Command output truncation | stdout 8,000 chars, stderr 4,000 chars | Prevent context flooding |
| Search results | 200 matches max; file search skips files > 1 MB | Bound search cost |
| Truncation detection | JSON parse check on tool args | Catch truncated model output |

## 4. V3 Pipeline (Inner Layer)

Activates inside `write_file`/`edit_file` executors for T2+ files. The pipeline has four phases with early exits at every stage.

### Phase Details

**Phase 0: Probe** generates a single baseline candidate with progressive budget retry (light → standard → nothink). It is scored with the selected model's C(x)/G(x) artifacts and tested in the sandbox. If it passes, the pipeline exits immediately.

**Candidate Allocation: the CxGx gate** (emitted as `phase2` / `phase2_allocated`) decides how many candidates the failed probe earns. The probe's combined C(x)+G(x) score (one embedding extraction, both models) drives a two-step rule: the calibrated C(x) normalized energy picks a base tier on the same ladder Budget Forcing uses, and the G(x) quality score escalates that tier by +1 when it falls below the model's calibrated severe boundary and +2 when it falls well below (0.75x it) — the case where the probe looks cheap to C(x) but wrong to G(x). The tier sets k (`nothink` 1, `standard` 3, `hard` 5, `extreme` 8) under a hard **k >= 3 floor**, so the gate can only add candidates to the previously pinned k=3, never remove them; its worst case is the old behavior. Both signals require this model's calibration files (`cx_normalization.json`, `gx_thresholds.json`): a missing, unreachable, or uncalibrated lens allocates exactly k=3 at `standard`, so an uncalibrated bundle runs the pipeline it ran before rather than routing on a scale that means nothing for it.

The floor is the difference between this and the C(x)-only allocator removed earlier: that one had no floor, so it handed k=1 to tasks whose probe had *just failed*. Whether lens-driven allocation beats fixed or randomly assigned tiers is unmeasured. An earlier four-arm comparison (gated, fixed k=3, the same tier mix shuffled across tasks, and k=8, at n=175 per arm) is not evidence either way: it ran on Qwen3.5-9B with a patched runner that is not in this repository, with thinking enabled on escalation, which the live gate cannot apply, on LiveCodeBench tasks the G(x) head was trained on, and at that sample size its arms are within noise of each other.

Live-path difference: the proxy's V3 bridge abandons a pipeline call after `ATLAS_V3_TIMEOUT` (default 180s), a cap the bench never had, so an unbounded escalation to k=8 would spend the budget on generation and return a timeout fallback instead of the k=3 answer the clock could have produced. The live orchestrator therefore passes its remaining wall-clock and the per-call latency observed on that task, and the gate lowers the tier to what the budget can actually generate — reserving one refinement iteration so the escalation cannot starve Phase 3 — never below the floor. The bench runner passes no budget and allocates exactly what was measured. `v3-service/stages/cxgx_gate.py`, shared by both orchestrators.

**Phase 1: Constraint-Driven Generation**

- **PlanSearch** generates structurally different implementation plans by extracting distinct constraint sets — one per allocated candidate slot the probe did not already fill (k-1)
- **DivSampling** applies perturbation diversity: 4 roles (competitive_programmer, systems_engineer, mathematician, pragmatist) + 4 instructions (step_by_step, edge_case_first, complexity_aware, constraint_driven) + 4 styles (functional, pythonic, optimize_iteratively, structured)
- **Budget Forcing** controls thinking token allocation:

| Tier | Thinking Tokens |
|------|----------------|
| nothink | 0 (template-level thinking disabled) |
| light | 1,024 |
| standard | 2,048 |
| hard | 4,096 |
| extreme | 8,192 |

Each tier maps to a system prompt (direct vs. think-step-by-step) and a max-token budget. Tier selection uses the selected model's calibrated C(x) energy; absent calibration, ATLAS uses the configured default budget rather than another model's constants.

**Phase 2: Verification and Selection**

- **Build Verification**: Python (`py_compile`), TypeScript (`tsc --noEmit`), JavaScript (`node --check`), Go (`go build`), Java (`javac`), Kotlin (`kotlinc`), Rust (`rustc` on the sandbox `/execute` path; `Cargo.toml` projects are detected with `cargo build`, and `cargo check` is accepted only via the build-command allowlist), C/C++ (full `gcc`/`g++` compile with `-Wall` on `/execute`; `-fsyntax-only` applies only to the `/syntax-check` route), Ruby (`ruby -c`, no compile step — interpreted), PHP (`php -l`, no compile step — interpreted), Shell (`bash -n`). Framework overrides for Next.js, React, Flask, Django, Express.
- **Vetoes**: three checks can reject a sandbox-passing candidate — the lens veto (per-step `gx_min` below the model's calibrated severe threshold: the code executes but the generation pattern collapsed toward a stub), the structural veto (tree-sitter finds a direct-identifier call resolving to no local def, import, builtin, or project symbol — a `NameError` in waiting), and the flag-gated call-graph veto (`ATLAS_CALL_GRAPH`: cross-file calls with no in-scope definition). A vetoed candidate is marked failed (`passed=false`, `vetoed_by`, veto reason as its error output) and joins the Phase-3 repair pool like any failing candidate; the final energy fallback never returns it. If every candidate is vetoed and repair fails, the pipeline returns no code and the caller substitutes its baseline
- **Lens Selection** (1+ passing): sort by C(x) energy, lowest wins

**Phase 3: Repair** (if 0/K pass, or every passer was vetoed) — two strategies, sequential with early exit:

- **Failure Analysis**: categorize failures (wrong_algorithm, implementation_bug, edge_case_miss, time_limit, format_error, partial_correct)
- **PR-CoT**: 4 perspectives (logical_consistency, information_completeness, biases, alternative_solutions) x (analysis + repair) = ~8 LLM calls, up to 3 rounds
- **Refinement Loop**: Failure Analysis → Constraint Refinement → Code Gen → Test → Learn. 2 iterations, 120s budget, ~5+ LLM calls each. Cosine distance filtering (>= 0.15) prevents hypothesis repetition. Budget-gated: the orchestrator enters the loop only when the remaining wall-clock (the `ATLAS_V3_TIMEOUT` cap live; the loop's own 120s budget in bench) can afford one iteration (~3 sequential LLM calls at the observed per-call latency) — otherwise it emits `refinement_skip` and goes straight to the fallback

### Module Map

The pipeline stages are 13 Python modules in `v3-service/stages/`. `v3-service/pipeline.py` orchestrates 11 of them (10 directly; `constraint_refinement` via the refinement loop); `lens_feedback` and `embedding_store` run only under the offline bench runner (`atlas/bench/v3_runner.py`, which puts the checkout's `v3-service/` on its path so both callers share one stage implementation):

Legend: blue = Phase 1 (generation), green = Phase 2 (selection), brown = Phase 3 (repair), gray = utilities. Modules fed by `v3_runner.py` are bench-runner-only; the service does not call them. The service itself is `main.py` (HTTP handler) → `pipeline.py` (orchestrator) → `planning.py` / `scoring.py` / `symbols.py` / `adapters.py` flat siblings.

## 5. Geometric Lens

Neural scoring system that evaluates code quality without executing it by analyzing the geometric structure of model embeddings. Runs entirely on CPU. The service surface is internal-only (`/internal/*`): C(x)/G(x) scoring (single-shot and per-step) plus the [pattern cache](#pattern-cache) that feeds lessons from previous sessions back into the agent loop.

#### Why "Geometric Lens"?

The core idea behind the Geometric Lens comes from a simple premise: stop scaling models and start wrapping them in supporting infrastructure. Jose Crespo's ["Everyone's Wrong About AI Programming"](https://www.josecrespophd.org/p/everyones-wrong-about-ai-programming) argues that AI-generated code drifts toward errors because current LLMs operate in flat embedding spaces where correct and incorrect code paths cost the same. The solution is to build an energy landscape around the model where correct code is "downhill" and incorrect code is "uphill."

Anthropic's [Manipulating Manifolds](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2025/linebreaks/index.html) research provides evidence that transformers already create manipulable geometric structures in their embedding space - the raw material is already there. Bar et al.'s [Geometric Unification of Generative AI](https://arxiv.org/html/2510.00666v1) formalizes how distance functions on data manifolds can be learned and used for scoring.

ATLAS implements this with two complementary models. C(x) is a learned energy function (`hidden_dim`→512→128→1 MLP) over the selected model's own embeddings. Each code candidate gets embedded by llama-server, and C(x) scores where it sits in that geometry. Low energy means the candidate clusters with known-correct code. High energy means it clusters with known-incorrect code. No external oracle, no execution required—just the geometry of the selected model's representations.

G(x) is the quality predictor - an XGBoost classifier over PCA-reduced embeddings that predicts pass/fail from where a candidate sits in the reduced space. Where C(x) answers "how good is this candidate?", G(x) answers "is this candidate likely to pass?" It is the only G(x) implementation: the earlier metric-tensor formulation and its correctability endpoint were removed once XGBoost became the deployed path (see git history for the geometry-aware variant).

The following figures describe the frozen reference artifacts used for the
published V3 study; they are provenance, not runtime dimensions or defaults:

| Model | Reference architecture | Training Data | Performance |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **C(x)** | 4096→512→128→1 MLP (SiLU, Softplus) | 597 LCB embeddings (504 PASS, 93 FAIL) | Val AUC 0.9467, sep 2.04x |
| **G(x)** | PCA(4096→128) + XGBoost | 13,398 embeddings (4,835 PASS, 8,563 FAIL) | PCA 80.8% variance |

C(x) normalization is `sigmoid(steepness × (energy - midpoint))`. The
selected model's `cx_normalization.json` supplies both values; `atlas lens
build` derives them from that model's labeled PASS/FAIL candidates. G(x)
verdict thresholds likewise come from `gx_thresholds.json`. Without either
calibration, normalized decisions stay neutral/uncalibrated rather than
borrowing the reference artifact's scale.

Every current Lens bundle also contains `model_identity.json`. The service
requires its model name to match the served-model id reported by
llama-server's `/v1/models` (with `ATLAS_MODEL_NAME` as the fallback when the
probe fails); embedding-width equality alone cannot establish compatibility
between two different models.

> **Note:** Model weights (.pt, .pkl files) are not committed to the repository — they are built during training and baked into the container image or mounted at runtime. When model files are absent, the service degrades gracefully: C(x) returns neutral energy, G(x) returns `gx_score: 0.5` and `verdict: "unavailable"`. Training data and weights are available on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/itigges22/ATLAS).

### Pattern cache

Cross-session memory: patterns written after successful runs are served back to future agent loops as context.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph write["Write path (v3-service, post-run)"]
        PE["Pattern Extractor"] --> PS["Pattern Store\nSQLite"]
        PS --> COO["Co-occurrence Graph\nHebbian edge weights"]
    end

    subgraph read["Read path (/internal/patterns/context)"]
        CLS["Task-type classifier\n(heuristic, on the task text)"] --> PSC["Pattern Scorer\ntype match × Ebbinghaus decay × success"]
        PSC --> EXP["1-hop expansion\nco_occurrence.get_linked_patterns"]
        EXP --> OUT["top-k patterns\n→ proxy [system note] injection"]
    end

    PS --> PSC
    COO --> EXP

    style write fill:#1a3a5c,color:#fff
    style read fill:#2d5016,color:#fff
```

Modules: `geometric-lens/cache/{pattern_store, pattern_extractor, pattern_scorer, co_occurrence, seed_patterns}.py`. Matching is pattern-type + recency + success rate — there is no retrieval index; the store seeds itself with `seed_patterns` on first boot, and every serve updates the pattern's access stats. The consumer side is the proxy's pattern-context injection (§ 3).

<a id="rag--pageindex-v2"></a><a id="confidence-router--pattern-cache"></a>

> **Removed subsystems.** Earlier releases shipped a RAG/PageIndex project indexer, a BM25 pattern matcher, and a Thompson-Sampling confidence router inside the lens. They were reachable only through lens endpoints nothing in the product called, and were removed in the 2026-08 simplification campaign (see CHANGELOG). The pattern cache above is what remains of that stack, rebuilt around a single always-on reader.

Language aliases accepted: `py`/`python3` (Python), `js`/`node` (JavaScript), `ts` (TypeScript), `golang` (Go), `java` (Java), `kt`/`kts` (Kotlin), `rs` (Rust), `c++` (C++), `rb` (Ruby), `php` (PHP), `sh`/`shell` (Bash). Common CLI tools are baked into the image (`git`, `sqlite3`, `jq`, `patch`, `zip`/`unzip`, `xz`, `curl`) plus binary-inspection tools (`strings`, `objdump`, `readelf`, `nm` via binutils, and `file`, `xxd`) — the container is non-root on a read-only base, so anything a task shells out to must be preinstalled; nothing can be apt-installed at runtime. `read_file` on a binary returns a pointer to these tools rather than raw bytes. Max execution time: 300s in the Docker deployment (compose sets `MAX_EXECUTION_TIME=${ATLAS_SANDBOX_MAX_EXECUTION_TIME:-300}` to match the proxy's 5-min `run_command` cap; the bare code default is 60s). Memory, CPU, and process caps are container-level: compose sets `mem_limit ${ATLAS_SANDBOX_MEM:-4g}`, `cpus ${ATLAS_SANDBOX_CPUS:-2}`, and `pids_limit ${ATLAS_SANDBOX_PIDS:-1024}`; `atlas init` writes host-appropriate values (~75% of RAM and cores) into `.env`. Two workspace paths: **`/execute`** (V3 candidate-test path) uses an ephemeral scratch dir under `/tmp/sandbox` (tmpfs); **`/shell`** (the agent's `run_command` route, plus `/jobs/*` for background processes) runs against `/workspace` — the bind-mounted project root from `ATLAS_PROJECT_DIR` (Docker) or hostPath `${ATLAS_PROJECTS_DIR}` (K3s), the same path the proxy sees.

## 7. Example VRAM Budget

One measured RTX 5060 Ti 16GB deployment using a 9B Q6 model and 32K context:

| Component | VRAM |
|-----------|------|
| Qwen3.5-9B-Q6_K model weights | ~6.9 GB |
| KV cache (32K context) | ~1.3 GB |
| **Total llama-server** | **~8.2 GB** |
| Geometric Lens | 0 (CPU-only, ~12 MB RAM for models, ~128 MB for PyTorch runtime) |
| v3-service | 0 (CPU-only) |
| sandbox | 0 (CPU-only) |
| atlas-proxy | 0 (Go binary, ~30 MB RAM) |
| **Free VRAM** | **~7.8 GB** |

All computation outside of llama-server runs on CPU. The GPU is used exclusively for LLM inference and embedding extraction.

### 7.1 VRAM Budget per Backend

The 8.2 GB / 7.8 GB-free split above is an example, not an ATLAS model default. Actual usage follows the model, quantization, context, and parallel-slot settings selected by `atlas init`. Other backends differ structurally:

| Backend | Reported "VRAM" | Realistic budget under load | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CUDA** (dedicated VRAM) | Hardware spec (16 GB on the canonical 5060 Ti) | ~95% of spec (driver reserves ~500 MB) | The numbers in the table above apply directly. |
| **ROCm** (dedicated VRAM) | Hardware spec | ~90–95% of spec (HIP runtime slightly heavier than CUDA's) | RX 7900 XTX (24 GB) → comfortably runs 14B Q5 + 32K context with 2 parallel slots. |
| **Metal** (Apple unified) | Total system RAM | **~70%** of system RAM | OS + browser + IDE eat ~30%. A 16 GB MBP has a *realistic* 11 GB budget — little headroom for Qwen3.5-9B Q6_K (~6.9 GB weights + ~1.3 GB KV at 32K, per §7) once macOS's own GPU working set is on the same memory. Use Q4_K_M (5 GB) on ≤16 GB; Q6_K wants ≥24 GB unified. |
| **Vulkan** (cross-vendor) | Hardware spec | No measured deployment yet (Preview — validated on the lavapipe CPU path only) | Expect ~20–40% below a tuned native backend on the same card. |
| **SYCL** (Intel Arc) | Hardware spec | Roadmap — Intel Arc uses Vulkan today | A770 (16 GB) target is conservative-equivalent to NVIDIA 16 GB. |

## 8. Deployment

Service dependency graph (identical across deployment modes):

    style V3 fill:#2d5016,color:#fff
    style SB fill:#2d5016,color:#fff
    style AP fill:#1a3a5c,color:#fff
```

`llama-server` and `sandbox` start independently. `geometric-lens` waits for `llama-server` to be healthy; `v3-service` waits for `llama-server` and `geometric-lens`; `atlas-proxy` waits for `llama-server`, `geometric-lens`, `v3-service`, and `sandbox`. The same `inference/entrypoint-v3.1.sh` drives Docker Compose, bare metal, and K3s, so context size, KV cache quantization, flash attention, and mlock are env-var-controlled and behavior is identical across those modes; the macOS hybrid path launches native llama-server via `scripts/atlas-llama-macos.sh`, which mirrors the entrypoint's flags.

Install and per-mode bring-up steps (NVIDIA / ROCm overrides, bare metal, macOS hybrid Metal, K3s manifests) are in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md); the macOS native path is in [SETUP_MACOS.md](SETUP_MACOS.md).

```

Minimum 3 llama-server calls for algorithmic tasks (1 probe generation + 1 self-test generation + 1 embedding extraction); interactive tasks (games, UIs, framework code) skip self-test generation, so their minimum is 2. Maximum 30+ if Phase 3 repair engages all strategies.

Existing files over 5 lines are rejected for `write_file` — the model must use `edit_file` (surgical, ≤10 lines) or `structural_edit` (whole-node rewrite, .py/.html/.htm only). On `.py`/`.html`/`.htm` files, the per-step grammar gate (BiasBusters #2) actively bans `edit_file`/`write_file` from the tool-name production for the next decision so the model can't relapse to the wrong shortcut.
