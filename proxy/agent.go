// Trust model (load-bearing — read before "fixing" go/path-injection CodeQL
// alerts on this file or its helpers in tools.go, context.go, gates.go).
//
// ATLAS is a single-tenant local-install agent. The proxy runs inside a
// container whose /workspace mount IS the user's project directory: the
// agent's whole purpose is to read, edit, and verify files there on
// behalf of the user who owns that directory. The "user-controlled" value
// CodeQL flags in agent path joins is almost always ctx.WorkingDir, which
// is set ONCE at agent startup from the bind mount — not from a per-
// request input. The few cases where the model emits a path
// (resolveAgentPath callers in tools.go) go through that resolver, which
// translates host-absolute paths into the container view + cleans `..`
// segments before any os call.
//
// What we deliberately do NOT do: enforce a strict in-workspace check
// that rejects paths resolving outside /workspace. The agent legitimately
// reads outside it (e.g. /etc/os-release for tier detection, /tmp for
// scratch). The container is the isolation boundary — host-side files
// not bind-mounted in are simply not reachable.
//
// If ATLAS is ever deployed multi-tenant (e.g. shared proxy with many
// users' workspaces colocated), every site flagged by go/path-injection
// here would need a real fix. Until then they're dismissed as false
// positives with this rationale.

Selector must match exactly one node; ambiguous selectors return an error so you can be more specific. Decorators are included automatically when selecting a Python function.

// travels to v3-service where it is read into a log line and never branched
// on. V3 activation is driven by classifyFileTier, which scores the file
// being edited — a different function that does use T1/T2/T3 meaningfully.
// So the only question here is conversational or not, and the returned
// non-T0 value is Tier2Medium because that is what every consumer treats
// every non-T0 value as.
//
// The costs are asymmetric, which sets the direction of the default.
// Misreading chat as a task wastes one planner call on a message the model
// answers and closes in a single turn. Misreading a task as chat caps it at
// 5 turns and skips planning, and a capped task fails: "the snake is still
// moving way too fast, please slow it down significantly" was classified
// conversational during 2026-07-21 dogfooding and returned a zero-tool-call
// non-answer instead of an edit.
//
// So T0 requires positive evidence, and the absence of a recognized task
