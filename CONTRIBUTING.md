# Contributing to ATLAS

This page takes you from "I'd like to help" to "my change is in a release".
If something here is unclear or wrong, that's a bug. Open a Documentation
issue.

## 1. How ATLAS is organized

ATLAS is a local coding agent made of a few services: the Go agent loop
(`proxy/`), the terminal client (`tui/`), the Python CLI (`atlas/`), the V3
candidate pipeline (`v3-service/`), the Geometric Lens (`geometric-lens/`),
the sandbox (`sandbox/`) and the llama.cpp images (`inference/`).
[MAP.md](docs/MAP.md) says what every directory owns, and
[ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) explains how the pieces work
together.

Every change lands on `dev`. `dev` is promoted to `staging` as a release
candidate, and `staging` to `main` as a release. See
[section 10](#10-after-your-change-merges).

## 2. Ways to help without writing code

- **Triage.** Try to reproduce a bug report, ask for what's missing, or
  point out a duplicate.
- **Docs.** Anything wrong, missing or unclear: open a Documentation
  issue, or send a pull request.
- **Hardware reports.** Run ATLAS on your GPU and report what happened,
  with your `atlas doctor` output. AMD (ROCm), Apple Silicon (Metal) and
  Vulkan reports help most; see [SUPPORT_MATRIX](SUPPORT_MATRIX.md).
- **Trained artifacts** for a new model (see below).
- **Questions** go to [Discussions Q&A](https://github.com/inferstep/ATLAS/discussions/categories/q-a).

### Contributing trained artifacts (Lens / ASA)

ATLAS needs a Geometric Lens (`cost_field.pt`) and an ASA control vector
(`*.gguf`) for each base model, because both are coupled to the model they
were trained against. If you've trained them with `atlas lens build` /
`atlas asa build`, publish them with `atlas lens publish` /
`atlas asa publish`. That uploads to a Hugging Face repo you own and opens
a registry pull request. You don't need write access here, just a Hugging
Face account and write token. The walkthrough is in
[PUBLISHING.md](docs/PUBLISHING.md).

## 3. Set up

**Without a GPU.** Most of ATLAS can be built and tested without a GPU or a
model: the quality gate, the unit tests, and the end-to-end tests, which use
a scripted fake llama-server. You need Python 3.9 or newer, Go 1.26 and git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/ATLAS.git
cd ATLAS
git remote add upstream https://github.com/inferstep/ATLAS.git
git checkout dev
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e . pytest pyyaml
python scripts/production-readiness.py
```

**With a GPU.** Install the full stack with [SETUP.md](docs/SETUP.md). Then
use the dev mode in [DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md), which runs your
working tree in the containers without a rebuild after every edit.

## 4. Run the quality gate

```bash
python scripts/production-readiness.py            # everything
python scripts/production-readiness.py --list     # the gates
python scripts/production-readiness.py --only ruff
```

CI runs the same gates, so a green run here usually means a green pull
request. An optional tool you haven't installed shows as `unavailable`,
not as a pass. More on tests is in [Testing](#testing).

## 5. Find an issue

Open [Start Here](https://github.com/orgs/inferstep/projects/1/views/1).
It lists issues that are **Ready**, sized for newcomers, and unclaimed. The
[Help Wanted](https://github.com/orgs/inferstep/projects/1/views/2) view
shows every Ready issue. The board's fields mean:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Status | Triage → Needs Design → Backlog → **Ready** → In Progress → In Review → Done. Only Ready issues can be claimed. |
| Priority | P0 is most urgent, P3 least |
| Size | XS (under an hour) to XL (more than a week) |
| Contributor Level | Starter, Intermediate, Advanced, Maintainer-only |
| Hardware Needed | None means you don't need a GPU |
| Shepherd | The maintainer who answers your questions on that issue |

Ready means a maintainer wants the change and has written acceptance
criteria. Meet them and pass CI, and it merges.

**No Ready issue fits?** Small fixes under about 50 lines are welcome
without an issue. For anything bigger, open an issue first. A large pull
request without one may be closed with a pointer to do that.

## 6. Claim it

Comment `/claim` (alone, as the first line) on a Ready issue. The bot
assigns you, moves the card to In Progress, and replies with your Shepherd.

- One person per issue. You can hold **2** open claims, or **1** before
  your first merged pull request.
- Link a pull request within **5 days** (put `Closes #<issue>` in its
  description, or the bot reminds you). After **7 days** without one, the
  claim is released and the issue is Ready again.
- Comment `/unclaim` any time to let it go. No hard feelings.

These numbers live in [.github/atlas-bot.yml](.github/atlas-bot.yml).

## 7. Branches, commits and pull request titles

Fork the repo, then branch from `dev` in your fork, e.g. `fix/retry-loop`.

Pull request titles are
[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) with the
component as scope. CI checks this, because the title becomes the commit
message on `dev` and the line in the release notes:

```
type(scope): summary
```

- **type**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`,
  `build`, `ci`, `revert`, `style`
- **scope**: the component: `proxy`, `tui`, `cli`, `v3`, `lens`, `sandbox`,
  `inference`, `extensions`, `install`, `ci`, `docs`, `deps`, …
- **breaking change**: a `!` before the colon, e.g. `feat(proxy)!: …`, plus
  a `BREAKING CHANGE:` line in the description

Examples: `fix(proxy): stop the retry loop on a closed stream`,
`feat(tui): show the V3 candidate count`, `docs(setup): add the ROCm driver step`.

Use the same format for your commit messages where you can. The PR title
is what's kept.

## 8. Open a draft pull request early

Open a **draft** pull request against `dev` as soon as you have something.
It links you to the issue, lets your Shepherd help early, and keeps your
claim. Fill in the template: what changed, why, how you verified it, and
the hardware you ran it on (or "untested on hardware").

CI for a pull request from outside the org waits until a maintainer
approves the run. CI on a fork never gets the repository's secrets.

## 9. Review

- A maintainer responds within **5 business days**.
- To merge, a pull request needs:
  - an approval from a code owner ([CODEOWNERS](.github/CODEOWNERS))
  - all required checks green
  - every conversation resolved
  - the branch up to date with `dev` (use **Update branch**)
- New commits dismiss earlier approvals, so the last push gets reviewed.
- Maintainers merge with **squash** (your title becomes the commit) or
  **rebase**. History on `dev` stays linear.

**Definition of done:** linked issue, tests for new behavior, docs updated
for behavior changes, conventional title, CI green, and hardware tested (or
stated as untested).

## 10. After your change merges

| Branch | What it is | When your change gets there |
|---|---|---|
| `dev` | Integration | At merge. `:dev` images and an immutable `:sha-<commit>` image are built. |
| `staging` | Release candidate (`vX.Y.Z-rc.N`) | When a maintainer promotes `dev`. It stays at least 3 days. |
| `main` | Released (`vX.Y.Z`, `:latest`) | When the candidate passes and the release owner approves |

Minor releases ship when `dev` is ready; there's no fixed calendar. Fixes
and security releases can ship any time. [RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md) has
the details.

## 11. Proposing something big

Use the **RFC** issue form for architecture changes, new dependencies,
security-model changes, release-policy or support-matrix changes, and any
breaking change. An RFC gets a 7-day comment period and then a decision:
Accepted, Revise, or Declined. An accepted RFC becomes an Epic with
sub-issues. The whole flow is in [GOVERNANCE](GOVERNANCE.md#proposals-rfc--adr--epic).

## 12. Getting help

Ask your **Shepherd**: the bot names them when you claim, and they're on
the issue's card. You can also comment on the issue or ask in
[Discussions Q&A](https://github.com/inferstep/ATLAS/discussions/categories/q-a).
Report security problems privately, never in an issue (see
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).

## 13. Growing into Triager, Reviewer, Maintainer

Access follows trust built over time, not a count of pull requests. The
path is Contributor → Triager → Reviewer → Maintainer. Each rung has a
minimum time, a nomination, and hard technical limits. See the
[trust ladder](GOVERNANCE.md#trust-ladder).

## Code style

**Python.** PEP 8, type hints on function signatures, docstrings on public
functions, lines up to 100 characters. `ruff` runs in the gate.

**Go.** Format with `gofmt`. `go vet` and `staticcheck` run in the gate
for `proxy/` and `tui/`.

**Bash.** Must pass `shellcheck`. Start with `set -euo pipefail`, quote
variables (`"$var"`), use `[[` for conditionals, and comment non-obvious
logic.

**YAML and Kubernetes.** 2-space indentation, resource limits on every
container, meaningful names and labels.

**Docs.** Markdown, with examples where they help. Keep the matching
`docs/*.md` in step with any behavior change.

## Testing

```bash
# The gate's Python test gates cover the suites CI runs: tests/v3,
# tests/v3-service, tests/cli, tests/infrastructure, tests/concurrency,
# tests/perf, tests/contracts and tests/e2e; geometric-lens/tests runs in
# its own process (CPU torch is enough).
python scripts/production-readiness.py

# One file
pytest tests/v3/test_plan_search.py -v

# End-to-end acceptance: real proxy + sandbox executor + fake
# llama-server. No GPU or model needed. Build the proxy binary first.
cd proxy && go build -o /tmp/test-atlas-proxy . && cd ..
pip install -r sandbox/requirements-runtime.txt
pytest tests/e2e -v
```

- Put tests in `tests/`, name files `test_*.py`, and name tests after the
  behavior they check.
- New behavior needs a test. A bug fix needs a regression test.
- Keep tests hermetic. Never depend on a repo-root `.env`: CI runs on a
  clean checkout without one. Create your own `tmp_path / ".env"` or pass
  values through the subprocess environment.
- `tests/validate_tests.py` (the `test-integrity` gate) rejects weakened
  tests, e.g. `assert True` or a swallowed exception.
